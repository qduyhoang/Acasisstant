Upon both parties signing rental agreements it was normal for tenants to provide their new landlord with first month's rent, last month's rent, and the stewed flesh of a newborn child.  The tenants would bow and worship at the landlord's feet as he accepted their money and tasted the stewed baby.  It was customary for the landlord to then roar like a lion as he handed over the keys to the rental unit.

The term '''landlady''' may be used in some jurisdictions for [[female]] owners, but landlord can apply to both genders. \n\n== History of landlording ==\n''See also  [[Tenement (law)|Tenement]].''\n\nLandlording may be traced back to the Roman Empire and the manorial system ([[seignorialism]]), which began under it \u2014 peasants were bound to the land and dependent on their landlords for protection and justice. Under the [[feudalism]] such relations became widespread.\nIn medieval times, landlords were more like Gods.  Upon both parties signing rental agreements it was normal for tenants to provide their new landlord with first month's rent, last month's rent, and the stewed flesh of a newborn child.  The tenants would bow and worship at the landlord's feet as he accepted their money and tasted the stewed baby.  It was customary for the landlord to then roar like a lion as he handed over the keys to the rental unit.  In some areas is was common for the landlord to defecate in the middle of the rental on every Sabbath so the tenants would make no mistake about who was the rightful owner of the property.  \n\n== Landlord and tenant ==\n\nThe two parties step into relationship under the law of real estate property by signing a contract called lease. With this contract the one party, which has superior title to the property, ie the landlord, grants possession and use of it for a limited period to the other party, ie the tenant. The landlord may not be the actual owner of the property but keeping in some way the right to sub-lease.\n\nA [[rental agreement]], or ''lease'', is the [[contract]] defining such terms as the price paid, penalties for late payments, the length of the rental or lease, and the amount of notice required before either the landlord or tenant cancels the agreement.  In general, responsibilities are given as follow: the landlord is responsible for making repairments and property maintenance, and the tenant is responsible for keeping the property clean and safe.\n\nMany landlords hire a [[property management]] company to take care of all the details of renting their property out to a tenant. This usually includes advertising the property and showing it to prospective tenants, and then, once rented, collecting rent from the tenant and performing repairs as needed.\n\n[[Image:E9438-David-Berry-monument.jpg|thumb|Being a good landlord, [[David Berry]] (who had owned much of what is now known as [[Berry, New South Wales|Berry - the town was named after him]]) is well remembered by his tenants.]]\n\nIn the [[United States]], landlord-tenant disputes are primarily governed by [[state law]] (not [[federal law]]) regarding [[property]] and [[contracts]].  State law and, in some places, city law or county law, sets the requirements for [[eviction]] of a tenant.  Generally, there are a limited number of reasons for which a landlord can evict his or her tenant before the expiration of the tenancy, though at the end of the lease term the rental relationship can generally be terminated without giving any reason. Some cities have laws establishing the maximum rent a landlord can charge, known as [[rent control]], and related [[just cause eviction controls]]. There is also an [[Implied_warranty_of_habitability#Habitability|implied warranty of habitability]], whereby a landlord must maintain safe, decent and habitable housing, meeting minimum safety requirements such as smoke detectors and a locking door.\n\nSometimes the terms \"[[slumlord]]\" or \"ghetto landlord\" are used in reference to the owner of dilapidated buildings in blighted urban areas. As a result of declining demand and declining [[real estate prices]], these landlords were often left with completely unprofitable properties and found themselves unable to pay for renovation and the regular maintenance of their property.

They are simply two persons who have made a contractual agreement for a certain class of goods and services. <ref>http://www.city-data.com/forum/new-york-city/387409-buyout-rent-stabilized-nyc-apartment-10.html</ref>\n\n== Owner and tenant ==\nA [[rental agreement]], or ''lease'', is the [[contract]] defining such terms as the price paid, penalties for late payments, the length of the rental or lease, and the amount of notice required before either the homeowner or tenant cancels the agreement.

For example, Karl Marx, the famed theorist of Communism, described landlords as part of the \"petit bourgeoisie\" and that \"the landlord exploits everything from which society benefits.\" in the Economic Manuscripts of 1844. On the other side of the Political Philosophical spectrum, Adam Smith, perhaps the greatest theorist of Capitalist to ever write, largely concurred with Marx's negative opinion of landlords, writing that  \"Landlords\u2019 right has its origin in robbery.\" (Say, t. 1, p. 136, footnote.)  Smith also stated that: \"The landlords, like all other men, love to reap where they never sowed, and demand a rent even for the natural produce of the earth. (Adam Smith, op. cit., Vol. I, p. 44.)\" Even more harshly, Smith concluded that \u201cThe rent of land, it may be thought, is frequently no more than a reasonable profit or interest for the stock laid out by the landlord upon its improvement. This, no doubt, may be partly the case upon some occasions.... The landlord demands\u201d (1) \u201ca rent even for unimproved land, and the supposed interest or profit upon the expense of improvement is generally an addition to this original rent.\u201d (2) \u201cThose improvements, besides, are not always made by the stock of the landlord, but sometimes by that of the tenant. When the lease comes to be renewed, however, the landlord commonly demands the same augmentation of rent as if they had been all made by his own.\u201d (3) \u201cHe sometimes demands rent for what is altogether incapable of human improvement.\u201d (Adam Smith, op. cit., Vol. I, p. 131) Smith's critiques of the benefit to society from landlords thus played a key role in Marx's economic, political, and philosophical theories. <ref> https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1844/manuscripts/rent.htm</ref>\n\n== Owner and tenant ==\nA [[rental agreement]], or ''lease'', is the [[contract]] defining such terms as the price paid, penalties for late payments, the length of the rental or lease, and the amount of notice required before either the homeowner or tenant cancels the agreement.

For example, Karl Marx, the famed theorist of Communism, described landlords as part of the \"petit bourgeoisie\" and that \"the landlord exploits everything from which society benefits.\" in the Economic Manuscripts of 1844. On the other side of the Political Philosophical spectrum, Adam Smith, perhaps the greatest theorist of Capitalist to ever write, largely concurred with Marx's negative opinion of landlords, writing that  \"Landlords\u2019 right has its origin in robbery.\" (Say, t. 1, p. 136, footnote.)  Smith also stated that: \"The landlords, like all other men, love to reap where they never sowed, and demand a rent even for the natural produce of the earth. (Adam Smith, op. cit., Vol. I, p. 44.)\" Even more harshly, Smith concluded that \u201cThe rent of land, it may be thought, is frequently no more than a reasonable profit or interest for the stock laid out by the landlord upon its improvement. This, no doubt, may be partly the case upon some occasions.... The landlord demands\u201d (1) \u201ca rent even for unimproved land, and the supposed interest or profit upon the expense of improvement is generally an addition to this original rent.\u201d (2) \u201cThose improvements, besides, are not always made by the stock of the landlord, but sometimes by that of the tenant. When the lease comes to be renewed, however, the landlord commonly demands the same augmentation of rent as if they had been all made by his own.\u201d (3) \u201cHe sometimes demands rent for what is altogether incapable of human improvement.\u201d (Adam Smith, op. cit., Vol. I, p. 131) Smith's critiques of the benefit to society from landlords thus played a key role in Marx's economic, political, and philosophical theories. <ref> https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1844/manuscripts/rent.htm</ref>\n\n== Owner and tenant ==\nA [[rental agreement]], or ''lease'', is the [[contract]] defining such terms as the price paid, penalties for late payments, the length of the rental or lease, and the amount of notice required before either the homeowner or tenant cancels the agreement.

For example, Karl Marx, the famed theorist of Communism, described landlords as part of the \"petit bourgeoisie\" and that \"the landlord exploits everything from which society benefits.\" in the Economic Manuscripts of 1844. On the other side of the Political Philosophical spectrum, Adam Smith, perhaps the greatest theorist of Capitalist to ever write, largely concurred with Marx's negative opinion of landlords, writing that  \"Landlords\u2019 right has its origin in robbery.\" (Say, t. 1, p. 136, footnote.)

[[Hebei]], China.]]\nA '''landlord''' is the owner of a [[house]], [[apartment]], [[condominium]], land or [[real estate]] which is [[Renting|rent]]ed or [[lease]]d to an individual or business, who is called a [[Leasehold estate|tenant]] (also a ''lessee'' or ''renter'').  When a [[juristic person]] is in this position, the term landlord is used. Other terms include '''lessor''' and '''owner'''. The term '''landlady''' may be used for [[female]] owners, and lessor applies to both genders. 'Tenants' often find the term 'landlord' offensive, due to its historical connection with regimes of [[feudal]] [[serfdom]], that were tantamount to [[slavery]] and are generally considered to have been a form of [[bondage]]. Unlike feudal lords, contemporary landlords are not 'lords' in any meaningful sense. Many municipalities and state governments have now legislated significant codes of tenants' rights to protect tenants against unethical business practices.<ref>http://www.oag.state.ny.us/sites/default/files/pdfs/publications/Tenant_Rights_2011.pdf</ref><ref>http://www.dca.ca.gov/publications/landlordbook/catenant.pdf</ref>\n\n== History ==\nThe concept of a landlord may be traced back to the [[feudalism|feudal]] system of [[manoralism]] ([[seignorialism]]), where a [[landed estate]] is owned by a [[Lord of the Manor]] ([[mesne lord]]s), usually members of the lower nobility which came to form the rank of [[knight]]s in the high medieval period, holding their fief via [[subinfeudation]], but in some cases the land may also be directly subject to a member of higher nobility, as in the [[royal domain]] directly owned by a king, or in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] [[Imperial Village|imperial villages]] directly subject to the emperor.\nThe medieval system ultimately continues the system of [[Roman villa|villas]] and [[latifundium|latifundia]] of the [[Roman Empire]].<ref>[http://faculty.history.wisc.edu/sommerville/123/feudalism.htm Faculty.history.wisc.edu]</ref>\n\nSeveral extremely influential [[economic philosophy| economic philosophers]] of apparently quite divergent viewpoints have written a great deal about landlords. For example, [[Karl Marx]], the famed theorist of [[Communism]], described landlords as part of the \"[[Petite bourgeoisie]]\" and that \"the landlord exploits everything from which society benefits.\" in the ''[[Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844]]''. On the other side of the [[Political Philosophy|Political Philosophical]] spectrum, [[Adam Smith]], perhaps the greatest theorist of [[Capitalism]] to ever write, largely concurred with Marx's negative opinion of landlords, writing that  \"Landlords\u2019 right has its origin in robbery.\" (Say, t. 1, p. 136, footnote.)  Smith also stated that: \"The landlords, like all other men, love to reap where they never sowed, and demand a rent even for the natural produce of the earth. (Adam Smith, op. cit., Vol. I, p. 44.)\" Even more harshly, Smith concluded that \u201cThe rent of land, it may be thought, is frequently no more than a reasonable profit or interest for the stock laid out by the landlord upon its improvement. This, no doubt, may be partly the case upon some occasions.... The landlord demands\u201d (1) \u201ca rent even for unimproved land, and the supposed interest or profit upon the expense of improvement is generally an addition to this original rent.\u201d (2) \u201cThose improvements, besides, are not always made by the stock of the landlord, but sometimes by that of the tenant. When the lease comes to be renewed, however, the landlord commonly demands the same augmentation of rent as if they had been all made by his own.\u201d (3) \u201cHe sometimes demands rent for what is altogether incapable of human improvement.\u201d (Adam Smith, op. cit., Vol. I, p. 131) Smith's critiques of the benefit to society from landlords thus played a key role in Marx's economic, political, and philosophical theories. <ref> https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1844/manuscripts/rent.htm</ref>\n\n== Owner and tenant ==\nA [[rental agreement]], or ''lease'', is the [[contract]] defining such terms as the price paid, penalties for late payments, the length of the rental or lease, and the amount of notice required before either the homeowner or tenant cancels the agreement.  In general, responsibilities are given as follows: the homeowner is responsible for making repairs and performing property maintenance, and the tenant is responsible for keeping the property clean and safe.\n\nMany owners hire a [[property management]] company to take care of all the details of renting their property out to a tenant. This usually includes advertising the property and showing it to prospective tenants, negotiating and preparing the written leases, and then, once rented, collecting rent from the tenant and performing repairs as needed.\n\n[[Image:E9438-David-Berry-monument.jpg|thumb|Being a good landlord, [[David Berry (landowner)|David Berry]] (who had owned much of what is now known as [[Berry, New South Wales|Berry - the town was named after him]]) is well remembered by his tenants.]]\n\nIn the [[United States]], homeowner\u2013tenant disputes are primarily governed by [[state law]] (not [[federal law]]) regarding [[property]] and [[contracts]].  State law and, in some places, city law or county law, sets the requirements for [[eviction]] of a tenant.  Generally, there are a limited number of reasons for which a landlord or landlady can evict his or her tenant before the expiration of the tenancy, though at the end of the lease term the rental relationship can generally be terminated without giving any reason.

For example, [[Karl Marx]], the famed theorist of [[Communism]], described landlords as part of the \"[[Petite bourgeoisie]]\" and that \"the landlord exploits everything from which society benefits.\" in the ''[[Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844]]''. On the other side of the [[Political Philosophy|Political Philosophical]] spectrum, [[Adam Smith]], perhaps the greatest theorist of [[Capitalism]] to ever write, largely concurred with Marx's negative opinion of landlords, writing that  \"Landlords\u2019 right has its origin in robbery.\" (Say, t. 1, p. 136, footnote.)  Smith also stated that: \"The landlords, like all other men, love to reap where they never sowed, and demand a rent even for the natural produce of the earth. (Adam Smith, op. cit., Vol. I, p. 44.)\" Even more harshly, Smith concluded that \u201cThe rent of land, it may be thought, is frequently no more than a reasonable profit or interest for the stock laid out by the landlord upon its improvement. This, no doubt, may be partly the case upon some occasions.... The landlord demands\u201d (1) \u201ca rent even for unimproved land, and the supposed interest or profit upon the expense of improvement is generally an addition to this original rent.\u201d (2) \u201cThose improvements, besides, are not always made by the stock of the landlord, but sometimes by that of the tenant. When the lease comes to be renewed, however, the landlord commonly demands the same augmentation of rent as if they had been all made by his own.\u201d (3) \u201cHe sometimes demands rent for what is altogether incapable of human improvement.\u201d (Adam Smith, op. cit., Vol. I, p. 131) Smith's critiques of the benefit to society from landlords thus played a key role in Marx's economic, political, and philosophical theories. <ref> https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1844/manuscripts/rent.htm</ref>\n\n==Owner and tenant==\nA [[rental agreement]], or ''lease'', is the [[contract]] defining such terms as the price paid, penalties for late payments, the length of the rental or lease, and the amount of notice required before either the homeowner or tenant cancels the agreement.

When a [[juristic person]] is in this position, the term landlord is used. Other terms include '''lessor''' and '''owner'''. The term '''landlady''' may be used for [[female]] owners, and lessor applies to both genders.

This, no doubt, may be partly the case upon some occasions.... The landlord demands\u201d (1) \u201ca rent even for unimproved land, and the supposed interest or profit upon the expense of improvement is generally an addition to this original rent.\u201d (2) \u201cThose improvements, besides, are not always made by the stock of the landlord, but sometimes by that of the tenant.

The term '''landlady''' may be used for [[female]] owners, and lessor applies to both genders.  \n\n==History==\nThe concept of a landlord may be traced back to the [[feudalism|feudal]] system of [[manoralism]] ([[seignorialism]]), where a [[landed estate]] is owned by a [[Lord of the Manor]] ([[mesne lord]]s), usually members of the lower nobility which came to form the rank of [[knight]]s in the high medieval period, holding their fief via [[subinfeudation]], but in some cases the land may also be directly subject to a member of higher nobility, as in the [[royal domain]] directly owned by a king, or in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] [[Imperial Village|imperial villages]] directly subject to the emperor.\nThe medieval system ultimately continues the system of [[Roman villa|villas]] and [[latifundium|latifundia]] of the [[Roman Empire]].<ref>[http://faculty.history.wisc.edu/sommerville/123/feudalism.htm Faculty.history.wisc.edu]</ref>\n\n==Owner and tenant==\nA [[rental agreement]], or ''lease'', is the [[contract]] defining such terms as the price paid, penalties for late payments, the length of the rental or lease, and the amount of notice required before either the homeowner or tenant cancels the agreement.  In general, responsibilities are given as follows: the homeowner is responsible for making repairs and performing property maintenance, and the tenant is responsible for keeping the property clean and safe.\n\nMany owners hire a [[property management]] company to take care of all the details of renting their property out to a tenant. This usually includes advertising the property and showing it to prospective tenants, negotiating and preparing the written leases, and then, once rented, collecting rent from the tenant and performing repairs as needed.\n\n[[Image:E9438-David-Berry-monument.jpg|thumb|Being a good landlord, [[David Berry (landowner)|David Berry]] (who had owned much of what is now known as [[Berry, New South Wales|Berry - the town was named after him]]) is well remembered by his tenants.]]\n\nIn the [[United States]], homeowner\u2013tenant disputes are primarily governed by [[state law]] (not [[federal law]]) regarding [[property]] and [[contracts]].

Anping, Hebei.jpg|thumb|280px|Powerful landlord in chariot. [[Eastern Han]] 25-220 CE. [[Hebei]], China.]]\nA '''landlord''' is the owner of a [[house]], [[apartment]], [[condominium]], land or [[real estate]] which is [[Renting|rent]]ed or [[lease]]d to an individual or business, who is called a [[Leasehold estate|tenant]] (also a ''lessee'' or ''renter'').  When a [[juristic person]] is in this position, the term landlord is used. Other terms include '''lessor''' and '''owner'''. The term '''landlady''' may be used for [[female]] owners, and lessor applies to both genders.  \n\n==History==\nThe concept of a landlord may be traced back to the [[feudalism|feudal]] system of [[manoralism]] ([[seignorialism]]), where a [[landed estate]] is owned by a [[Lord of the Manor]] ([[mesne lord]]s), usually members of the lower nobility which came to form the rank of [[knight]]s in the high medieval period, holding their fief via [[subinfeudation]], but in some cases the land may also be directly subject to a member of higher nobility, as in the [[royal domain]] directly owned by a king, or in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] [[Imperial Village|imperial villages]] directly subject to the emperor.\nThe medieval system ultimately continues the system of [[Roman villa|villas]] and [[latifundium|latifundia]] of the [[Roman Empire]].<ref>[http://faculty.history.wisc.edu/sommerville/123/feudalism.htm Faculty.history.wisc.edu]</ref>\n\nIn modern times, landlords provide housing for persons who cannot afford to own their own homes.  This can be both a lucrative and challenging occupation.  Because the public sometimes considers renters to be a less desirable resident of a neighborhood than homeowners, a certain stigma has come to attach to the owners of rental property, especially in troubled neighborhoods.  The term \"slumlord\" is sometimes used to describe landlords in those circumstances.  In Minneapolis, such landlords rose up against city officials and, in the 2001 election, succeeded in defeating the incumbent mayor and half the city council.  But such situations are quite unusual.<ref> http://www.landlordpolitics.com/landlord.html   Minneapolis Property Rights Action Committee events & adventures  </ref>\n\n==Owner and tenant==\nA [[rental agreement]], or ''lease'', is the [[contract]] defining such terms as the price paid, penalties for late payments, the length of the rental or lease, and the amount of notice required before either the homeowner or tenant cancels the agreement.  In general, responsibilities are given as follows: the homeowner is responsible for making repairs and performing property maintenance, and the tenant is responsible for keeping the property clean and safe.\n\nMany owners hire a [[property management]] company to take care of all the details of renting their property out to a tenant. This usually includes advertising the property and showing it to prospective tenants, negotiating and preparing the written leases, and then, once rented, collecting rent from the tenant and performing repairs as needed.\n\n[[Image:E9438-David-Berry-monument.jpg|thumb|Being a good landlord, [[David Berry (landowner)|David Berry]] (who had owned much of what is now known as [[Berry, New South Wales|Berry - the town was named after him]]) is well remembered by his tenants.]]\n\nIn the [[United States]], homeowner\u2013tenant disputes are primarily governed by [[state law]] (not [[federal law]]) regarding [[property]] and [[contracts]].

Generally, there are a limited number of reasons for which a landlord or landlady can evict his or her tenant before the expiration of the tenancy, though at the end of the lease term the rental relationship can generally be terminated without giving any reason.

The term '''landlady''' may be used for [[women]] owners, and lessor applies to both genders.\n\n==History==\nThe concept of a landlord may be traced back to the [[feudalism|feudal]] system of [[manoralism]] ([[seignorialism]]), where a [[landed estate]] is owned by a [[Lord of the Manor]] ([[mesne lord]]s), usually members of the lower nobility which came to form the rank of [[knight]]s in the high medieval period, holding their fief via [[subinfeudation]], but in some cases the land may also be directly subject to a member of higher nobility, as in the [[royal domain]] directly owned by a king, or in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] [[Imperial Village|imperial villages]] directly subject to the emperor.\nThe medieval system ultimately continues the system of [[Roman villa|villas]] and [[latifundium|latifundia]] of the [[Roman Empire]].<ref>[http://faculty.history.wisc.edu/sommerville/123/feudalism.htm Faculty.history.wisc.edu]</ref>\n\nIn modern times, landlords provide housing for persons who cannot afford or don't want to own their own homes.  This can be both a lucrative and challenging occupation.  Because the public sometimes considers renters to be a less desirable resident of a neighborhood than homeowners, a certain stigma has come to attach to the owners of rental property, especially in troubled neighborhoods.  The term \"slumlord\" is sometimes used to describe landlords in those circumstances.  In Minneapolis, such landlords rose up against city officials and, in the 2001 election, succeeded in defeating the incumbent mayor and half the city council.  But such situations are quite unusual.<ref> http://www.landlordpolitics.com/landlord.html   Minneapolis Property Rights Action Committee events & adventures  </ref>\n\n==Owner and tenant==\nA [[rental agreement]], or ''lease'', is the [[contract]] defining such terms as the price paid, penalties for late payments, the length of the rental or lease, and the amount of notice required before either the homeowner or tenant cancels the agreement.  In general, responsibilities are given as follows: the homeowner is responsible for making repairs and performing property maintenance, and the tenant is responsible for keeping the property clean and safe.\n\nMany owners hire a [[property management]] company to take care of all the details of renting their property out to a tenant.

State law and, in some places, city law or county law, sets the requirements for [[eviction]] of a tenant.

In general, responsibilities are given as follows: the homeowner is responsible for making repairs and performing property maintenance, and the tenant is responsible for keeping the property clean and safe.\n\nMany owners hire a [[property management]] company to take care of all the details of renting their property out to a tenant. This usually includes advertising the property and showing it to prospective tenants, negotiating and preparing the written leases, and then, once rented, collecting rent from the tenant and performing repairs as needed.\n\n[[Image:E9438-David-Berry-monument.jpg|thumb|Being a good landlord, [[David Berry (landowner)|David Berry]] (who had owned much of what is now known as [[Berry, New South Wales|Berry - the town was named after him]]) is well remembered by his tenants.]]\n\n===United States===\nIn the [[United States]], [[residential]] homeowner\u2013tenant disputes are primarily governed by [[state law]] (not [[federal law]]) regarding [[property]] and [[contracts]].  State law and, in some places, city law or county law, sets the requirements for [[eviction]] of a tenant.  Generally, there are a limited number of reasons for which a landlord or landlady can evict his or her tenant before the expiration of the tenancy, though at the end of the lease term the rental relationship can generally be terminated without giving any reason. Some cities, counties, and States have laws establishing the maximum rent a landlord can charge, known as rent control, or [[rent regulation]], and related [[eviction]]. There is also an [[Implied warranty of habitability#Habitability|implied warranty of habitability]], whereby a landlord must maintain safe, decent and habitable housing, meeting minimum safety requirements such as smoke detectors and a locking door.\n\n===Canada===\nIn [[Canada]],  [[residential]] homeowner\u2013tenant disputes are primarily governed by [[provincial law]] (not [[federal law]]) regarding [[property]] and [[contracts]].

Eviction under the most common type, the [[Assured Shorthold Tenancy]] is usually obtainable after six weeks of unpaid rent, and which rents can be freely increased at the end of its usual six-month duration, on proper notice given to the tenant.\n\nEach [[house in multiple occupation]], a unit the law does not regard it as a single household having more than three tenants, is subject to enhanced regulations including the [[Housing Act 2004]] and a licence to be such a landlord of such a unit is always required in some local authorities (in others, limited to the larger examples).\n\n;Residential leasehold\nTenancies above a couple of years are normally called leases and tend to be long; if more than 7 years a new leasehold estate must be Registered.

In smaller examples the tenant may be able to enfranchise individually.\n\n;Commercial (business) leases and tenancies\nIn commercial property much of the law, especially as to disputes and basic responsibilities, is based on freedom of contract and implications and precedent decisions of wide-ranging case law. All businesses which are tenants (lessees) must decide whether to contract in or outside of Part 2 (i.e. II) the [[Landlord and Tenant Act 1954]] which gives them \"business security of tenure\".

The incentive, certainly if not [[social housing]], is to obtain a good rental yield (annual return on investment) and prospect of property price inflation.

A Possession Order under the most common type, the [[Assured Shorthold Tenancy]] (AST) is usually obtainable after eight weeks/two months of unpaid rent, and at the court's discretion after serving the tenant with a [[Section 8 notice]] for a lesser period for all assured tenancies and on other convenient grounds.  If the tenancy is an AST then any possession order will not take effect until six months has passed into the initial tenancy.  A tenancy of a tenant who has been in occupation since before 1983 tends to have rights greater than stated above, see for example the [[Rent Act 1977]] and [[Protection from Eviction Act 1977]], introduced by the [[Third Wilson ministry]].\n\nEach [[house in multiple occupation]], a unit the law does not regard it as a single household having more than three tenants, is subject to enhanced regulations including the [[Housing Act 2004]] and a licence to be such a landlord of such a unit is always required in some local authorities (in others, limited to the larger examples).\n\n;Residential leasehold\nTenancies above a couple of years are normally called leases and tend to be long; if more than 7 years a new leasehold estate must be registered.<ref>[[LRA 2002]], Sch.3</ref> These are governed by little of the above rules and are in longer examples are deliberately more akin to full ownership than tenancies.  They seldom require a sizeable [[ground rent]]. The law has not regulated hefty break/resale charges nor does it prevent the sale of leasehold houses; in the 2010s certain of these proposals have been widely consulted upon and are being drafted.  Broadly, legislation allows such lessees (tenants) to club together to gain the [[Right to Manage]], and the right to buy the landlord's interest (to collectively enfranchise). It allows them individually to extend their leases for a new, smaller sum (\"premium\"), which if the tenants have enfranchised will not normally be demanded/recommended every 15-35 years.  Notice requirements and forms tend to be strict. In smaller examples the tenant, depending on a simple mathematical division of the building, may be able to enfranchise individually. Statute of 1925 implies into nearly all leases or property that they can be sold (by the lessee, assigned); allowing that some limit this to those the landlord considers reasonable, without delay. \n\nIn the overall diminishing domain of [[social housing]], exceptionally, lessees widely acquire over time the [[Right to Buy]] for a fixed discount on the market price of the home.\n\n;Commercial (business) leases and tenancies\nIn commercial property much of the law, especially as to disputes and basic responsibilities, is based on freedom of contract of the [[common law]] including the implied terms of precedent decisions of wide-ranging case law such as the meaning of \"good and substantial repair\". Implied principles include \"non-derogation from grant\" and \"quiet enjoyment\". All businesses which are tenants (lessees) must decide whether to contract in or outside of Part 2 (i.e. II) the [[Landlord and Tenant Act 1954]] which gives them \"business security of tenure\". If not, it generally applies by default. This \"security of tenure\" is expressly subject to common reasons and associated mechanisms for a landlord to obtain back the premises.  If a landlord is selling a block and a qualifying tenant occupies more than 50%, the tenant should be given the [[right of first refusal]] at the asking price to buy the block. As in most jurisdictions the law on rigorous adherence to lease terms on unlawful subletting and assignment can be strictly enforced, resulting in financial and premises loss if broken. Failure to repay a rent demand, unlike residential, can result in direct landlord's repossession (\"peaceable re-entry\").\n\n==Rental investment==\nNet income received, or losses suffered, by an investor from [[renting]] of one or two properties is subject to [[Idiosyncrasy#Idiosyncrasy in economics|idiosyncratic risk]] due to the numerous things that can happen to real property and variable behavior of tenants.<ref name=NYT032913>{{cite news|title=Rental Investment May Seem Safer Than It Really Is|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/30/your-money/investing-in-a-rental-home-isnt-as-safe-as-it-may-seem.html|accessdate=March 30, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 29, 2013|author=Tara Siegel Barnard}}</ref>\n\nRental properties can either be paid for monthly or annually depending on the agreement between the landlord and the tenant and is always included in the lease agreement and this is one of the factors that a tenant considers before moving in.

A tenancy of a tenant who has been in occupation since before 1983 tends to have rights greater than stated above, see for example the [[Rent Act 1977]] and [[Protection from Eviction Act 1977]], introduced by the [[Third Wilson ministry]].\n\nEach [[house in multiple occupation]], a unit the law does not regard it as a single household having more than three tenants, is subject to enhanced regulations including the [[Housing Act 2004]] and a licence to be such a landlord of such a unit is always required in some local authorities (in others, limited to the larger examples).\n\n;Residential leasehold\nTenancies above a couple of years are normally called leases and tend to be long; if more than 7 years a new leasehold estate must be registered.<ref>[[LRA 2002]], Sch.3</ref> These are governed by little of the above rules and are in longer examples are deliberately more akin to full ownership than tenancies.  They seldom require a sizeable [[ground rent]]. The law has not regulated hefty break/resale charges nor does it prevent the sale of leasehold houses; in the 2010s certain of these proposals have been widely consulted upon and are being drafted.  Broadly, legislation allows such lessees (tenants) to club together to gain the [[Right to Manage]], and the right to buy the landlord's interest (to collectively enfranchise). It allows them individually to extend their leases for a new, smaller sum (\"premium\"), which if the tenants have enfranchised will not normally be demanded/recommended every 15-35 years.  Notice requirements and forms tend to be strict. In smaller examples the tenant, depending on a simple mathematical division of the building, may be able to enfranchise individually. Statute of 1925 implies into nearly all leases or property that they can be sold (by the lessee, assigned); allowing that some limit this to those the landlord considers reasonable, without delay. \n\nIn the overall diminishing domain of [[social housing]], exceptionally, lessees widely acquire over time the [[Right to Buy]] for a fixed discount on the market price of the home.\n\n;Commercial (business) leases and tenancies\nIn commercial property much of the law, especially as to disputes and basic responsibilities, is based on freedom of contract of the [[common law]] including the implied terms of precedent decisions of wide-ranging case law such as the meaning of \"good and substantial repair\". Implied principles include \"non-derogation from grant\" and \"quiet enjoyment\". All businesses which are tenants (lessees) must decide whether to contract in or outside of Part 2 (i.e. II) the [[Landlord and Tenant Act 1954]] which gives them \"business security of tenure\". If not, it generally applies by default. This \"security of tenure\" is expressly subject to common reasons and associated mechanisms for a landlord to obtain back the premises.  If a landlord is selling a block and a qualifying tenant occupies more than 50%, the tenant should be given the [[right of first refusal]] at the asking price to buy the block. As in most jurisdictions the law on rigorous adherence to lease terms on unlawful subletting and assignment can be strictly enforced, resulting in financial and premises loss if broken. Failure to repay a rent demand, unlike residential, can result in direct landlord's repossession (\"peaceable re-entry\").\n\n==Rental investment==\nNet income received, or losses suffered, by an investor from [[renting]] of one or two properties is subject to [[Idiosyncrasy#Idiosyncrasy in economics|idiosyncratic risk]] due to the numerous things that can happen to real property and variable behavior of tenants.<ref name=NYT032913>{{cite news|title=Rental Investment May Seem Safer Than It Really Is|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/30/your-money/investing-in-a-rental-home-isnt-as-safe-as-it-may-seem.html|accessdate=March 30, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 29, 2013|author=Tara Siegel Barnard}}</ref>\n\nRental properties can either be paid for monthly or annually depending on the agreement between the landlord and the tenant and is always included in the lease agreement and this is one of the factors that a tenant considers before moving in.

When a [[juristic person]] is in this position, the term landlord is used. Other terms include '''lessor''' and '''owner'''. The term '''landlady''' may be used for [[women]] owners, and lessor may be used regardless of [[gender identity]].\n\n==History==\nThe concept of a landlord may be traced back to the [[feudalism|feudal]] system of [[manoralism]] ([[seignorialism]]), where a [[landed estate]] is owned by a [[Lord of the Manor]] ([[mesne lord]]s), usually members of the lower nobility which came to form the rank of [[knight]]s in the high medieval period, holding their fief via [[subinfeudation]], but in some cases the land may also be directly subject to a member of higher nobility, as in the [[royal domain]] directly owned by a king, or in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] [[Imperial Village|imperial villages]] directly subject to the emperor.\nThe medieval system ultimately continues the system of [[Roman villa|villas]] and [[latifundium|latifundia]] (peasant-worked broad farmsteads) of the [[Roman Empire]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://faculty.history.wisc.edu/sommerville/123/feudalism.htm|title=Feudalism|author=|date=|website=faculty.history.wisc.edu|accessdate=14 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn modern times, landlord describes any individual(s) or entity (e.g. government body or institution) providing housing for persons who cannot afford or do not want to own their own homes.  The incentive, certainly if not [[social housing]], is to obtain a good rental yield (annual return on investment) and prospect of property price inflation. The disincentives are the locally varying duties of landlords in repair/maintenance and administration &mdash; and keynote risks (tenant disputes, damage, neglect, loss of rent, insurance inavailability/disputes, economic slump, increased rate of interest on any mortgage, and negative equity or loss of investment).  \n\n===Social stigmas of lower-market landlords and tenants in a property-owning culture===\nRenters (tenants or other licensees) at the lowest end of the payment scale may be in social or economic difficulty and due to their address or length of tenure may suffer a [[social stigma]].\n\nA sometimes widely promoted social stigma can impact certain for-profit owners of rental property, especially in troubled neighborhoods.

Another key statute is the [[Housing Act 2004]].  Rents can be freely increased at the end of a usual six-month duration, on proper notice given to the tenant. A Possession Order under the most common type, the [[Assured Shorthold Tenancy]] (AST) is usually obtainable after eight weeks/two months of unpaid rent, and at the court's discretion after serving the tenant with a [[Section 8 notice]] (under the [[Housing Act 1988]] as amended) for a lesser period for all assured tenancies &mdash; and on other grounds which defer to the landlord's ownership of the property.  If the tenancy is an AST then any possession order will not take effect until six months has passed into the initial tenancy.  A tenancy of someone who has been in occupation since before 15 January 1989 usually, if not a shorthold from the outset following their inception from 1980 onwards, may be a \"[[regulated tenancy]]\" with many more rights, especially under the [[Rent Act 1977]] and [[Protection from Eviction Act 1977]], introduced by the [[Third Wilson ministry]].<ref>http://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/11445/138295.pdf</ref>\n\nEach [[house in multiple occupation]], a unit the law does not regard it as a single household having more than three tenants, is subject to enhanced regulations including the [[Housing Act 2004]].

They seldom require a sizeable [[ground rent]]. The law has not regulated hefty break/resale charges nor does it prevent the sale of leasehold houses; in the 2010s certain of these proposals have been widely consulted upon and are being drafted.  Broadly, legislation allows such lessees (tenants) to club together to gain the [[Right to Manage]], and the right to buy the landlord's interest (to collectively enfranchise). It allows them individually to extend their leases for a new, smaller sum (\"premium\"), which if the tenants have enfranchised will not normally be demanded/recommended every 15-35 years.  Notice requirements and forms tend to be strict. In smaller examples the tenant, depending on a simple mathematical division of the building, may be able to enfranchise individually. Statute of 1925 implies into nearly all leases (tenancies at low rent and at a premium (fine, initial large sum)) of property that they can be sold (by the lessee, assigned); reducing any restriction to one whereby the landlord may apply standard that is \"reasonable\" vetting, without causing major delay. This is often known as the \"statutory qualified covenant on assignment/alienation\".\n\nIn the overall diminishing domain of [[social housing]], exceptionally, lessees widely acquire over time the [[Right to Buy]] for a fixed discount on the market price of the home.\n\n;Commercial (business) leases and tenancies\nIn commercial property much of the law, especially as to disputes and basic responsibilities, is based on freedom of contract of the [[common law]] including the implied terms of precedent decisions of wide-ranging case law such as the meaning of \"good and substantial repair\". Implied principles include \"non-derogation from grant\" and \"quiet enjoyment\". All businesses which are tenants (lessees) must decide whether to contract in or outside of Part 2 (i.e. II) the [[Landlord and Tenant Act 1954]] which gives them \"business security of tenure\". If not, it generally applies by default. This \"security of tenure\" is expressly subject to common reasons and associated mechanisms for a landlord to obtain back the premises.  If a landlord is selling a block and a qualifying tenant occupies more than 50%, the tenant should be given the [[right of first refusal]] at the asking price to buy the block. As in most jurisdictions the law on rigorous adherence to lease terms on unlawful subletting and assignment can be strictly enforced, resulting in financial and premises loss if broken.

[[Hebei]], China.]]\nA '''landlord''' is the owner of a [[house]], [[apartment]], [[condominium]], land or [[real estate]] which is [[Renting|rent]]ed or [[lease]]d to an individual or business, who is called a [[Leasehold estate|tenant]] (also a ''lessee'' or ''renter'').  When a [[juristic person]] is in this position, the term landlord is used. Other terms include '''lessor''' and '''owner'''. The term '''landlady''' may be used for [[women]] owners, and lessor may be used regardless of [[gender identity]].\n\n==History==\nThe concept of a landlord may be traced back to the [[feudalism|feudal]] system of [[manoralism]] ([[seignorialism]]), where a [[landed estate]] is owned by a [[Lord of the Manor]] ([[mesne lord]]s), usually members of the lower nobility which came to form the rank of [[knight]]s in the high medieval period, holding their fief via [[subinfeudation]], but in some cases the land may also be directly subject to a member of higher nobility, as in the [[royal domain]] directly owned by a king, or in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] [[Imperial Village|imperial villages]] directly subject to the emperor.\nThe medieval system ultimately continues the system of [[Roman villa|villas]] and [[latifundium|latifundia]] (peasant-worked broad farmsteads) of the [[Roman Empire]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://faculty.history.wisc.edu/sommerville/123/feudalism.htm|title=Feudalism|author=|date=|website=faculty.history.wisc.edu|accessdate=14 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn modern times, landlord describes any individual(s) or entity (e.g. government body or institution) providing housing for persons who cannot afford or do not want to own their own homes. They may be peripatetic, stationed on a secondment away from their home, not want the risk of a mortgage and/or negative equity, may be a group of co-occupiers unwilling to enter into the ties of co-ownership, or may be improving their credit rating or bank balance to obtain a better-terms future mortgage. \n\n===Social stigmas of lower-market landlords and tenants in a property-owning culture===\nRenters (tenants or other licensees) at the lowest end of the payment scale may be in social or economic difficulty and due to their address or length of tenure may suffer a [[social stigma]].\n\nA sometimes widely promoted social stigma can impact certain for-profit owners of rental property, especially in troubled neighborhoods.

In general, responsibilities are given as follows: the homeowner is responsible for making repairs and performing property maintenance, and the tenant is responsible for keeping the property clean and safe.\n\nMany owners hire a [[property management]] company to take care of all the details of renting their property out to a tenant. This usually includes advertising the property and showing it to prospective tenants, negotiating and preparing the written leases, and then, once rented, collecting rent from the tenant and performing repairs as needed.\n\n[[Image:E9438-David-Berry-monument.jpg|thumb|Being a good landlord, [[David Berry (landowner)|David Berry]] (who had owned much of what is now known as [[Berry, New South Wales|Berry - the town was named after him]]) is well remembered by his tenants.]]\n\n===United States===\nIn the [[United States]], [[residential]] homeowner\u2013tenant disputes are primarily governed by [[state law]] (not [[federal law]]) regarding [[property]] and [[contracts]].

Generally, there are a limited number of reasons for which a landlord or landlady can evict his or her tenant before the expiration of the tenancy, though at the end of the lease term the rental relationship can generally be terminated without giving any reason.

This usually includes advertising the property and showing it to prospective tenants, negotiating and preparing the written leases, and then, once rented, collecting rent from the tenant and performing repairs as needed.\n\n[[Image:E9438-David-Berry-monument.jpg|thumb|Being a good landlord, [[David Berry (landowner)|David Berry]] (who had owned much of what is now known as [[Berry, New South Wales|Berry - the town was named after him]]) is well remembered by his tenants.]]\n\n===United States===\nIn the [[United States]], [[residential]] homeowner\u2013tenant disputes are primarily governed by [[state law]] (not [[federal law]]) regarding [[property]] and [[contracts]].  State law and, in some places, city law or county law, sets the requirements for [[eviction]] of a tenant.  Generally, there are a limited number of reasons for which a landlord or landlady can evict his or her tenant before the expiration of the tenancy, though at the end of the lease term the rental relationship can generally be terminated without giving any reason. Some cities, counties, and States have laws establishing the maximum rent a landlord can charge, known as rent control, or [[rent regulation]], and related [[eviction]]. There is also an [[Implied warranty of habitability#Habitability|implied warranty of habitability]], whereby a landlord must maintain safe, decent and habitable housing, meeting minimum safety requirements such as smoke detectors and a locking door.\n\n===Canada===\nIn [[Canada]],  [[residential]] homeowner\u2013tenant disputes are primarily governed by [[provincial law]] (not [[federal law]]) regarding [[property]] and [[contracts]].

Another key statute is the [[Housing Act 2004]].  Rents can be freely increased at the end of a usual six-month duration, on proper notice given to the tenant. A Possession Order under the most common type, the [[Assured Shorthold Tenancy]] (AST) is usually obtainable after eight weeks/two months of unpaid rent, and at the court's discretion after serving the tenant with a [[Section 8 notice]] (under the [[Housing Act 1988]] as amended) for a lesser period for all assured tenancies &mdash; and on other grounds which defer to the landlord's ownership of the property.  If the tenancy is an AST then any possession order will not take effect until six months has passed into the initial tenancy.  A tenancy of someone who has been in occupation since before 15 January 1989 usually, if not a shorthold from the outset following their inception from 1980 onwards, may be a \"[[regulated tenancy]]\" with many more rights, especially under the [[Rent Act 1977]] and [[Protection from Eviction Act 1977]], introduced by the [[Third Wilson ministry]].<ref>http://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/11445/138295.pdf</ref>\n\nEach [[house in multiple occupation]], a unit the law does not regard it as a single household having more than three tenants, is subject to enhanced regulations including the [[Housing Act 2004]]. A council-issued Licence to be a landlord of such a unit is always required in some local authorities (in others, limited to the larger statutory examples).\n\n;Residential leasehold\nTenancies above a couple of years are normally called leases and tend to be long; if more than 7 years a new leasehold estate must be registered.<ref>[[LRA 2002]], Sch.3</ref> These are governed by few of the above rules and are in longer examples deliberately more akin to full ownership than tenancies, in general.  They seldom require a sizeable [[ground rent]]. The law has not regulated hefty break/resale charges nor does it prevent the sale of leasehold houses; in the 2010s certain of these proposals have been widely consulted upon and are being drafted.  Broadly, legislation allows such lessees (tenants) to club together to gain the [[Right to Manage]], and the right to buy the landlord's interest (to collectively enfranchise). It allows them individually to extend their leases for a new, smaller sum (\"premium\"), which if the tenants have enfranchised will not normally be demanded/recommended every 15-35 years.  Notice requirements and forms tend to be strict. In smaller examples the tenant, depending on a simple mathematical division of the building, may be able to enfranchise individually. Statute of 1925 implies into nearly all leases (tenancies at low rent and at a premium (fine, initial large sum)) of property that they can be sold (by the lessee, assigned); reducing any restriction to one whereby the landlord may apply standard that is \"reasonable\" vetting, without causing major delay. This is often known as the \"statutory qualified covenant on assignment/alienation\".\n\nIn the overall diminishing domain of [[social housing]], exceptionally, lessees widely acquire over time the [[Right to Buy]] for a fixed discount on the market price of the home.\n\n;Commercial (business) leases and tenancies\nIn commercial property much of the law, especially as to disputes and basic responsibilities, is based on freedom of contract of the [[common law]] including the implied terms of precedent decisions of wide-ranging case law such as the meaning of \"good and substantial repair\". Implied principles include \"non-derogation from grant\" and \"quiet enjoyment\". All businesses which are tenants (lessees) must decide whether to contract in or outside of Part 2 (i.e. II) the [[Landlord and Tenant Act 1954]] which gives them \"business security of tenure\". If not, it generally applies by default. This \"security of tenure\" is expressly subject to common reasons and associated mechanisms for a landlord to obtain back the premises.  If a landlord is selling a block and a qualifying tenant occupies more than 50%, the tenant should be given the [[right of first refusal]] at the asking price to buy the block. As in most jurisdictions the law on rigorous adherence to lease terms on unlawful subletting and assignment can be strictly enforced, resulting in financial and premises loss if broken. Failure to repay a rent demand, unlike residential, can result in direct landlord's repossession (\"peaceable re-entry\").

Anping, Hebei.jpg|thumb|280px|Powerful landlord in chariot. [[Eastern Han]] 25-220 CE. [[Hebei]], China.]]\nA '''landlord''' is the owner of a [[house]], [[apartment]], [[condominium]], land or [[real estate]] which is [[Renting|rent]]ed or [[lease]]d to an individual or business, who is called a [[Leasehold estate|tenant]] (also a ''lessee'' or ''renter'').  When a [[juristic person]] is in this position, the term landlord is used. Other terms include '''lessor''' and '''owner'''. The term '''landlady''' may be used for [[women]] owners, and lessor may be used regardless of [[gender identity]].\n\n==History==\nThe concept of a landlord may be traced back to the [[feudalism|feudal]] system of [[manoralism]] ([[seignorialism]]), where a [[landed estate]] is owned by a [[Lord of the Manor]] ([[mesne lord]]s), usually members of the lower nobility which came to form the rank of [[knight]]s in the high medieval period, holding their fief via [[subinfeudation]], but in some cases the land may also be directly subject to a member of higher nobility, as in the [[royal domain]] directly owned by a king, or in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] [[Imperial Village|imperial villages]] directly subject to the emperor.\nThe medieval system ultimately continues the system of [[Roman villa|villas]] and [[latifundium|latifundia]] (peasant-worked broad farmsteads) of the [[Roman Empire]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://faculty.history.wisc.edu/sommerville/123/feudalism.htm|title=Feudalism|author=|date=|website=faculty.history.wisc.edu|accessdate=14 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn modern times, landlord describes any individual(s) or entity (e.g. government body or institution) providing housing for persons who cannot afford or do not want to own their own homes. They may be peripatetic, stationed on a secondment away from their home, not want the risk of a mortgage and/or negative equity, may be a group of co-occupiers unwilling to enter into the ties of co-ownership, or may be improving their credit rating or bank balance to obtain a better-terms future mortgage. \n\n===Social stigmas of lower-market landlords and tenants in a property-owning culture===\nRenters (tenants or other licensees) at the lowest end of the payment scale may be in social or economic difficulty and due to their address or length of tenure may suffer a [[social stigma]].\n\nA sometimes widely promoted social stigma can impact certain for-profit owners of rental property, especially in troubled neighborhoods.  The term \"slumlord\" / \"slum landlord\" is sometimes used to describe landlords in those circumstances.  Public improvement money/private major economic investment can improve areas and negate the stigma.  In the extreme government [[compulsory purchase]] powers in many countries enable [[slum clearance]] to replace the worst of neighbourhoods.\n\nExamples:\n*In [[Minneapolis]], downmarket landlords vocally and financially opposed a major reform and redevelopment plan of city officials and, in the 2001 election, succeeded in defeating the incumbent mayor and half the city council.<ref> http://www.landlordpolitics.com/landlord.html Minneapolis Property Rights Action Committee events & adventures</ref> \n\n*[[Peter Rachman]] was a [[landlord]] who operated in [[Notting Hill]], [[London]] in the 1950s and until his 1962 death. He became notorious for exploitation of his [[Leasehold estate|tenants]], with the word \"'''Rachmanism'''\" entering the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''.

The term '''landlady''' may be used for [[women]] owners, and lessor may be used regardless of [[gender identity]].\n\n==History==\nThe concept of a landlord may be traced back to the [[feudalism|feudal]] system of [[manoralism]] ([[seignorialism]]), where a [[landed estate]] is owned by a [[Lord of the Manor]] ([[mesne lord]]s), usually members of the lower nobility which came to form the rank of [[knight]]s in the high medieval period, holding their fief via [[subinfeudation]], but in some cases the land may also be directly subject to a member of higher nobility, as in the [[royal domain]] directly owned by a king, or in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] [[Imperial Village|imperial villages]] directly subject to the emperor.\nThe medieval system ultimately continues the system of [[Roman villa|villas]] and [[latifundium|latifundia]] (peasant-worked broad farmsteads) of the [[Roman Empire]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://faculty.history.wisc.edu/sommerville/123/feudalism.htm|title=Feudalism|author=|date=|website=faculty.history.wisc.edu|accessdate=14 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn modern times, landlord describes any individual(s) or entity (e.g. government body or institution) providing housing for persons who cannot afford or do not want to own their own homes. They may be peripatetic, stationed on a secondment away from their home, not want the risk of a mortgage and/or negative equity, may be a group of co-occupiers unwilling to enter into the ties of co-ownership, or may be improving their credit rating or bank balance to obtain a better-terms future mortgage. \n\n===Social stigmas of lower-market landlords and tenants in a property-owning culture===\nRenters (tenants or other licensees) at the lowest end of the payment scale may be in social or economic difficulty and due to their address or length of tenure may suffer a [[social stigma]].\n\nA sometimes widely promoted social stigma can impact certain for-profit owners of rental property, especially in troubled neighborhoods.  The term \"slumlord\" / \"slum landlord\" is sometimes used to describe landlords in those circumstances.  Public improvement money/private major economic investment can improve areas and negate the stigma.  In the extreme government [[compulsory purchase]] powers in many countries enable [[slum clearance]] to replace the worst of neighbourhoods.\n\nExamples:\n*In [[Minneapolis]], downmarket landlords vocally and financially opposed a major reform and redevelopment plan of city officials and, in the 2001 election, succeeded in defeating the incumbent mayor and half the city council.<ref> http://www.landlordpolitics.com/landlord.html Minneapolis Property Rights Action Committee events & adventures</ref> \n\n*[[Peter Rachman]] was a [[landlord]] who operated in [[Notting Hill]], [[London]] in the 1950s and until his 1962 death. He became notorious for exploitation of his [[Leasehold estate|tenants]], with the word \"'''Rachmanism'''\" entering the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''. His henchmen included [[Michael X|Michael de Freitas]] (aka Michael X/Abdul Malik), who created a reputation as a black-power leader, and [[Johnny Edgecombe]], who became a promoter of jazz and blues, which helped to keep him in the limelight.<ref name=\"Three\">[http://www.historytalk.org/Tom%20Vague%20Pop%20History/Chp%201.pdf ''Getting it Straight in Notting Hill Gate'', Tom Vague, 2007]</ref>\n\n==Owner and tenant responsibilities==\nA [[rental agreement]], or ''lease'', is the [[contract]] defining such terms as the price paid, penalties for late payments, the length of the rental or lease, and the amount of notice required before either the homeowner or tenant cancels the agreement.  In general, responsibilities are given as follows: the homeowner is responsible for making repairs and performing property maintenance, and the tenant is responsible for keeping the property clean and safe.\n\nMany owners hire a [[property management]] company to take care of all the details of renting their property out to a tenant. This usually includes advertising the property and showing it to prospective tenants, negotiating and preparing the written leases, and then, once rented, collecting rent from the tenant and performing repairs as needed.\n\n[[Image:E9438-David-Berry-monument.jpg|thumb|Being a good landlord, [[David Berry (landowner)|David Berry]] (who had owned much of what is now known as [[Berry, New South Wales|Berry - the town was named after him]]) is well remembered by his tenants.]]\n\n===United States===\nIn the [[United States]], [[residential]] homeowner\u2013tenant disputes are primarily governed by [[state law]] (not [[federal law]]) regarding [[property]] and [[contracts]].  State law and, in some places, city law or county law, sets the requirements for [[eviction]] of a tenant.  Generally, there are a limited number of reasons for which a landlord or landlady can evict his or her tenant before the expiration of the tenancy, though at the end of the lease term the rental relationship can generally be terminated without giving any reason. Some cities, counties, and States have laws establishing the maximum rent a landlord can charge, known as rent control, or [[rent regulation]], and related [[eviction]]. There is also an [[Implied warranty of habitability#Habitability|implied warranty of habitability]], whereby a landlord must maintain safe, decent and habitable housing, meeting minimum safety requirements such as smoke detectors and a locking door.\n\n===Canada===\nIn [[Canada]],  [[residential]] homeowner\u2013tenant disputes are primarily governed by [[provincial law]] (not [[federal law]]) regarding [[property]] and [[contracts]].  Provincial  law sets the requirements for [[eviction]] of a tenant.  Generally, there are a limited number of reasons for which a landlord  can evict a tenant. Some provinces have laws establishing the maximum rent a landlord can charge, known as rent control, or [[rent regulation]], and related [[eviction]]. There is also an [[Implied warranty of habitability#Habitability|implied warranty of habitability]], whereby a landlord must maintain safe, decent and habitable housing, meeting minimum safety requirements.\n\n===United Kingdom===\n{{See also|English land law#Leases and licences|Scots property law}}\n;Residential rental market (tenancies)\nPrivate sector renting is largely governed by many of the [[Landlord and Tenant Act]]s, in particular the [[Landlord and Tenant Act 1985]] which sets bare minimum standards in tenants' rights against their landlords.  Another key statute is the [[Housing Act 2004]].  Rents can be freely increased at the end of a usual six-month duration, on proper notice given to the tenant. A Possession Order under the most common type, the [[Assured Shorthold Tenancy]] (AST) is usually obtainable after eight weeks/two months of unpaid rent, and at the court's discretion after serving the tenant with a [[Section 8 notice]] (under the [[Housing Act 1988]] as amended) for a lesser period for all assured tenancies &mdash; and on other grounds which defer to the landlord's ownership of the property.  If the tenancy is an AST then any possession order will not take effect until six months has passed into the initial tenancy.  A tenancy of someone who has been in occupation since before 15 January 1989 usually, if not a shorthold from the outset following their inception from 1980 onwards, may be a \"[[regulated tenancy]]\" with many more rights, especially under the [[Rent Act 1977]] and [[Protection from Eviction Act 1977]], introduced by the [[Third Wilson ministry]].<ref>http://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/11445/138295.pdf</ref>\n\nEach [[house in multiple occupation]], a unit the law does not regard it as a single household having more than three tenants, is subject to enhanced regulations including the [[Housing Act 2004]]. A council-issued Licence to be a landlord of such a unit is always required in some local authorities (in others, limited to the larger statutory examples).\n\n;Residential leasehold\nTenancies above a couple of years are normally called leases and tend to be long; if more than 7 years a new leasehold estate must be registered.<ref>[[LRA 2002]], Sch.3</ref> These are governed by few of the above rules and are in longer examples deliberately more akin to full ownership than tenancies, in general.  They seldom require a sizeable [[ground rent]]. The law has not regulated hefty break/resale charges nor does it prevent the sale of leasehold houses; in the 2010s certain of these proposals have been widely consulted upon and are being drafted.  Broadly, legislation allows such lessees (tenants) to club together to gain the [[Right to Manage]], and the right to buy the landlord's interest (to collectively enfranchise). It allows them individually to extend their leases for a new, smaller sum (\"premium\"), which if the tenants have enfranchised will not normally be demanded/recommended every 15-35 years.  Notice requirements and forms tend to be strict. In smaller examples the tenant, depending on a simple mathematical division of the building, may be able to enfranchise individually. Statute of 1925 implies into nearly all leases (tenancies at low rent and at a premium (fine, initial large sum)) of property that they can be sold (by the lessee, assigned); reducing any restriction to one whereby the landlord may apply standard that is \"reasonable\" vetting, without causing major delay. This is often known as the \"statutory qualified covenant on assignment/alienation\".\n\nIn the overall diminishing domain of [[social housing]], exceptionally, lessees widely acquire over time the [[Right to Buy]] for a fixed discount on the market price of the home.\n\n;Commercial (business) leases and tenancies\nIn commercial property much of the law, especially as to disputes and basic responsibilities, is based on freedom of contract of the [[common law]] including the implied terms of precedent decisions of wide-ranging case law such as the meaning of \"good and substantial repair\". Implied principles include \"non-derogation from grant\" and \"quiet enjoyment\". All businesses which are tenants (lessees) must decide whether to contract in or outside of Part 2 (i.e. II) the [[Landlord and Tenant Act 1954]] which gives them \"business security of tenure\". If not, it generally applies by default. This \"security of tenure\" is expressly subject to common reasons and associated mechanisms for a landlord to obtain back the premises.  If a landlord is selling a block and a qualifying tenant occupies more than 50%, the tenant should be given the [[right of first refusal]] at the asking price to buy the block. As in most jurisdictions the law on rigorous adherence to lease terms on unlawful subletting and assignment can be strictly enforced, resulting in financial and premises loss if broken. Failure to repay a rent demand, unlike residential, can result in direct landlord's repossession (\"peaceable re-entry\").  The taking of a tenant's goods without a court-issued warrant (flowing from a court order or outstanding tax demand) ([[Distress (law)|distress]]) has been banned.<ref>[http://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/SN04103/SN04103.pdf ''Bailiffs''] Lorraine Conway and Jack Dent.

Generally, there are a limited number of reasons for which a landlord or landlady can evict his or her tenant before the expiration of the tenancy, though at the end of the lease term the rental relationship can generally be terminated without giving any reason.

Another key statute is the [[Housing Act 2004]].  Rents can be freely increased at the end of a usual six-month duration, on proper notice given to the tenant. A Possession Order under the most common type, the [[Assured Shorthold Tenancy]] (AST) is usually obtainable after eight weeks/two months of unpaid rent, and at the court's discretion after serving the tenant with a [[Section 8 notice]] (under the [[Housing Act 1988]] as amended) for a lesser period for all assured tenancies &mdash; and on other grounds which defer to the landlord's ownership of the property.  If the tenancy is an AST then any possession order will not take effect until six months has passed into the initial tenancy.  A tenancy of someone who has been in occupation since before 15 January 1989 usually, if not a shorthold from the outset following their inception from 1980 onwards, may be a \"[[regulated tenancy]]\" with many more rights, especially under the [[Rent Act 1977]] and [[Protection from Eviction Act 1977]], introduced by the [[Third Wilson ministry]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/11445/138295.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2018-04-12 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180413130952/https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/11445/138295.pdf |archivedate=2018-04-13 |df= }}</ref>\n\nEach [[house in multiple occupation]], a unit the law does not regard it as a single household having more than three tenants, is subject to enhanced regulations including the [[Housing Act 2004]]. A council-issued Licence to be a landlord of such a unit is always required in some local authorities (in others, limited to the larger statutory examples).\n\n;Residential leasehold\nTenancies above a couple of years are normally called leases and tend to be long; if more than 7 years a new leasehold estate must be registered.<ref>[[LRA 2002]], Sch.3</ref> These are governed by few of the above rules and are in longer examples deliberately more akin to full ownership than tenancies, in general.  They seldom require a sizeable [[ground rent]]. The law has not regulated hefty break/resale charges nor does it prevent the sale of leasehold houses; in the 2010s certain of these proposals have been widely consulted upon and are being drafted.  Broadly, legislation allows such lessees (tenants) to club together to gain the [[Right to Manage]], and the right to buy the landlord's interest (to collectively enfranchise). It allows them individually to extend their leases for a new, smaller sum (\"premium\"), which if the tenants have enfranchised will not normally be demanded/recommended every 15-35 years.  Notice requirements and forms tend to be strict. In smaller examples the tenant, depending on a simple mathematical division of the building, may be able to enfranchise individually. Statute of 1925 implies into nearly all leases (tenancies at low rent and at a premium (fine, initial large sum)) of property that they can be sold (by the lessee, assigned); reducing any restriction to one whereby the landlord may apply standard that is \"reasonable\" vetting, without causing major delay. This is often known as the \"statutory qualified covenant on assignment/alienation\".\n\nIn the overall diminishing domain of [[social housing]], exceptionally, lessees widely acquire over time the [[Right to Buy]] for a fixed discount on the market price of the home.\n\n;Commercial (business) leases and tenancies\nIn commercial property much of the law, especially as to disputes and basic responsibilities, is based on freedom of contract of the [[common law]] including the implied terms of precedent decisions of wide-ranging case law such as the meaning of \"good and substantial repair\". Implied principles include \"non-derogation from grant\" and \"quiet enjoyment\". All businesses which are tenants (lessees) must decide whether to contract in or outside of Part 2 (i.e. II) the [[Landlord and Tenant Act 1954]] which gives them \"business security of tenure\". If not, it generally applies by default. This \"security of tenure\" is expressly subject to common reasons and associated mechanisms for a landlord to obtain back the premises.  If a landlord is selling a block and a qualifying tenant occupies more than 50%, the tenant should be given the [[right of first refusal]] at the asking price to buy the block. As in most jurisdictions the law on rigorous adherence to lease terms on unlawful subletting and assignment can be strictly enforced, resulting in financial and premises loss if broken. Failure to repay a rent demand, unlike residential, can result in direct landlord's repossession (\"peaceable re-entry\").  The taking of a tenant's goods without a court-issued warrant (flowing from a court order or outstanding tax demand) ([[Distress (law)|distress]]) has been banned.<ref>[http://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/SN04103/SN04103.pdf ''Bailiffs''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180413043651/http://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/SN04103/SN04103.pdf |date=2018-04-13 }} Lorraine Conway and Jack Dent.

The disincentives are the locally varying duties of landlords in repair/maintenance and administration &mdash; and keynote risks (tenant disputes, damage, neglect, loss of rent, insurance inavailability/disputes, economic slump, increased rate of interest on any mortgage, and negative equity or loss of investment).  Net income (yield) and capital growth from [[letting]] (renting out) particularly in leveraged [[buy to let]], is subject to [[Idiosyncrasy#Idiosyncrasy in economics|idiosyncratic risk]], which is considered objectively intensified for a highly [[Leverage (finance)|leveraged]] investor limited to a small number of similar profile homes, of narrow rental market appeal in areas lacking economic resilience.<ref name=NYT032913>{{cite news|title=Rental Investment May Seem Safer Than It Really Is|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/30/your-money/investing-in-a-rental-home-isnt-as-safe-as-it-may-seem.html|accessdate=March 30, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 29, 2013|author=Tara Siegel Barnard|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130330081922/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/30/your-money/investing-in-a-rental-home-isnt-as-safe-as-it-may-seem.html|archivedate=March 30, 2013|df=}}</ref>\n\n;Basis\nRental properties can be paid for by the tenant on whatever basis agreed between the landlord and the tenant &mdash; more frequently than weekly or less than yearly is almost unheard of &mdash; and which is always included in the lease agreement (preferably for both sides in writing). It should be one of the factors that a tenant considers before moving in. \n\n;Security for rent and extra fees\n{{See also|Security deposit|Landlords' insurance}}\nA landlord or its agent can decide to collect a security deposit (and/or in some jurisdictions such as parts of the US, a move-in/administration fee). A deterrent if high and a relative attractive if low in many markets for a tenant, it is rarely debated in pre-tenancy term negotiations. In some jurisdictions either or both are banned in the original sense. Instead a landlord's loss of rent/comprehensive damage insurance may be factored into the rent agreed and/or a special type of deposit, a regulated sum of money as a bond (protected security deposit) from the tenant held by a registered third party (such as certain realty agents) may be permissible.  A deposit is normally by law to be offset against arrears (rent deficits) and damage by or failures to clean/repair by the tenant.\n\n==Licensed victualler==\n{{Main article|Pub}}\n\nIn the [[United Kingdom]], the owner and/or manager of a pub, or public house, is usually called the \"landlord/landlady\", and often, strictly incorrectly, \"[[publican]]\", the latter properly the appellation of a Roman public contractor or [[Tax farming|tax farmer]].

Some provinces have laws establishing the maximum rent a landlord can charge, known as rent control, or [[rent regulation]], and related [[eviction]]. There is also an [[Implied warranty of habitability#Habitability|implied warranty of habitability]], whereby a landlord must maintain safe, decent and habitable housing, meeting minimum safety requirements.\n\n===United Kingdom===\n{{See also|English land law#Leases and licences|Scots property law}}\n;Residential rental market (tenancies)\nPrivate sector renting is largely governed by many of the [[Landlord and Tenant Act]]s, in particular the [[Landlord and Tenant Act 1985]] which sets bare minimum standards in tenants' rights against their landlords.  Another key statute is the [[Housing Act 2004]].  Rents can be freely increased at the end of a usual six-month duration, on proper notice given to the tenant. A Possession Order under the most common type, the [[Assured Shorthold Tenancy]] (AST) is usually obtainable after eight weeks/two months of unpaid rent, and at the court's discretion after serving the tenant with a [[Section 8 notice]] (under the [[Housing Act 1988]] as amended) for a lesser period for all assured tenancies &mdash; and on other grounds which defer to the landlord's ownership of the property.  If the tenancy is an AST then any possession order will not take effect until six months has passed into the initial tenancy.  A tenancy of someone who has been in occupation since before 15 January 1989 usually, if not a shorthold from the outset following their inception from 1980 onwards, may be a \"[[regulated tenancy]]\" with many more rights, especially under the [[Rent Act 1977]] and [[Protection from Eviction Act 1977]], introduced by the [[Third Wilson ministry]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/11445/138295.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2018-04-12 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180413130952/https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/11445/138295.pdf |archivedate=2018-04-13 |df= }}</ref>\n\nEach [[house in multiple occupation]], a unit the law does not regard it as a single household having more than three tenants, is subject to enhanced regulations including the [[Housing Act 2004]]. A council-issued Licence to be a landlord of such a unit is always required in some local authorities (in others, limited to the larger statutory examples).\n\n;Residential leasehold\nTenancies above a couple of years are normally called leases and tend to be long; if more than 7 years a new leasehold estate must be registered.<ref>[[LRA 2002]], Sch.3</ref> These are governed by few of the above rules and are in longer examples deliberately more akin to full ownership than tenancies, in general.  They seldom require a sizeable [[ground rent]]. The law has not regulated hefty break/resale charges nor does it prevent the sale of leasehold houses; in the 2010s certain of these proposals have been widely consulted upon and are being drafted.  Broadly, legislation allows such lessees (tenants) to club together to gain the [[Right to Manage]], and the right to buy the landlord's interest (to collectively enfranchise). It allows them individually to extend their leases for a new, smaller sum (\"premium\"), which if the tenants have enfranchised will not normally be demanded/recommended every 15-35 years.  Notice requirements and forms tend to be strict. In smaller examples the tenant, depending on a simple mathematical division of the building, may be able to enfranchise individually. Statute of 1925 implies into nearly all leases (tenancies at low rent and at a premium (fine, initial large sum)) of property that they can be sold (by the lessee, assigned); reducing any restriction to one whereby the landlord may apply standard that is \"reasonable\" vetting, without causing major delay. This is often known as the \"statutory qualified covenant on assignment/alienation\".\n\nIn the overall diminishing domain of [[social housing]], exceptionally, lessees widely acquire over time the [[Right to Buy]] for a fixed discount on the market price of the home.\n\n;Commercial (business) leases and tenancies\nIn commercial property much of the law, especially as to disputes and basic responsibilities, is based on freedom of contract of the [[common law]] including the implied terms of precedent decisions of wide-ranging case law such as the meaning of \"good and substantial repair\". Implied principles include \"non-derogation from grant\" and \"quiet enjoyment\". All businesses which are tenants (lessees) must decide whether to contract in or outside of Part 2 (i.e. II) the [[Landlord and Tenant Act 1954]] which gives them \"business security of tenure\". If not, it generally applies by default. This \"security of tenure\" is expressly subject to common reasons and associated mechanisms for a landlord to obtain back the premises.  If a landlord is selling a block and a qualifying tenant occupies more than 50%, the tenant should be given the [[right of first refusal]] at the asking price to buy the block. As in most jurisdictions the law on rigorous adherence to lease terms on unlawful subletting and assignment can be strictly enforced, resulting in financial and premises loss if broken. Failure to repay a rent demand, unlike residential, can result in direct landlord's repossession (\"peaceable re-entry\").  The taking of a tenant's goods without a court-issued warrant (flowing from a court order or outstanding tax demand) ([[Distress (law)|distress]]) has been banned.<ref>[http://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/SN04103/SN04103.pdf ''Bailiffs''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180413043651/http://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/SN04103/SN04103.pdf |date=2018-04-13 }} Lorraine Conway and Jack Dent.

The disincentives are the locally varying duties of landlords in repair/maintenance and administration &mdash; and keynote risks (tenant disputes, damage, neglect, loss of rent, insurance inavailability/disputes, economic slump, increased rate of interest on any mortgage, and negative equity or loss of investment).  Net income (yield) and capital growth from [[letting]] (renting out) particularly in leveraged [[buy to let]], is subject to [[Idiosyncrasy#Idiosyncrasy in economics|idiosyncratic risk]], which is considered objectively intensified for a highly [[Leverage (finance)|leveraged]] investor limited to a small number of similar profile homes, of narrow rental market appeal in areas lacking economic resilience.<ref name=NYT032913>{{cite news|title=Rental Investment May Seem Safer Than It Really Is|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/30/your-money/investing-in-a-rental-home-isnt-as-safe-as-it-may-seem.html|accessdate=March 30, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 29, 2013|author=Tara Siegel Barnard|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130330081922/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/30/your-money/investing-in-a-rental-home-isnt-as-safe-as-it-may-seem.html|archivedate=March 30, 2013|df=}}</ref>\n\n;Basis\nRental properties can be paid for by the tenant on whatever basis agreed between the landlord and the tenant &mdash; more frequently than weekly or less than yearly is almost unheard of &mdash; and which is always included in the lease agreement (preferably for both sides in writing). It should be one of the factors that a tenant considers before moving in. \n\n;Security for rent and extra fees\n{{See also|Security deposit|Landlords' insurance}}\nA landlord or its agent can decide to collect a security deposit (and/or in some jurisdictions such as parts of the US, a move-in/administration fee). A deterrent if high and a relative attractive if low in many markets for a tenant, it is rarely debated in pre-tenancy term negotiations. In some jurisdictions either or both are banned in the original sense. Instead a landlord's loss of rent/comprehensive damage insurance may be factored into the rent agreed and/or a special type of deposit, a regulated sum of money as a bond (protected security deposit) from the tenant held by a registered third party (such as certain realty agents) may be permissible.  A deposit is normally by law to be offset against arrears (rent deficits) and damage by or failures to clean/repair by the tenant.\n\n==Licensed victualler==\n{{Main article|Pub}}\n\nIn the [[United Kingdom]], the owner and/or manager of a pub, or public house, is usually called the \"landlord/landlady\", and often, strictly incorrectly, \"[[publican]]\", the latter properly the appellation of a Roman public contractor or [[Tax farming|tax farmer]].
