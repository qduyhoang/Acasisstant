In the [[United Kingdom]] the manager of a [[public house]] is also called the landlord or, more formally, as the '''licensed victualler'''.  A female landlord can either be called a ''landlady'' or simply landlord.  When a [[legal person]] is in the same position the term landlord is used.  Other terms used are '''lessor''' and '''owner'''.  The tenant can also be called a lesee or renter.  \n\nIn the [[United States]], landlord-tenant disputes are primarily governed by [[state law]] (not [[federal law]]) regarding [[property]] and [[contracts]].  State law and, in some places, city law or county law, sets the requirements for [[eviction]] of a tenant.  Generally, there are a limited number of reasons for which a landlord can evict his tenant before the expiration of the tenancy.  Some cities have laws establishing the maximum rent a landlord can charge, known as [[rent control]]. \n\nA [[rental agreement]], or ''lease'', is the [[contract]] defining such terms as the price paid, penalties for late payments, the length of the rental or lease, and the amount of notice required before either the landlord or tenant cancels the agreement.  In general, the landlord is responsible for repairs and maintenance, and the tenant is responsible for keeping the property clean and safe.\n\nMany landlords hire a [[property management]] company to take care of all the details of renting their property out to a tenant.  This usually includes advertising the property and showing it to prospective tenants, and then, once rented, collecting rent from the tenant and performing repairs as needed.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Eviction]]\n*[[Housing tenure]]\n\n==External links==\n*[http:\/\/www.tenant.net\/ Tenant Net] America's oldest and biggest tenant resource\n*[http:\/\/www.ontariotenants.ca Ontario Tenant Rights] Canada's most popular tenant resource\n*[http:\/\/www.landlord-tenant.org\/ Landlord and Tenant]:  A guide to residential lettings for both landlords and tenants\n\n[[category:Real estate]]\n\n[[ja:\u5730\u4e3b]]\n[[zh:\u571f\u5730\u4e3b]]",

The tenant can also be called a lesee or renter.  \n\nIn the [[United States]], landlord-tenant disputes are primarily governed by [[state law]] (not [[federal law]]) regarding [[property]] and [[contracts]].  State law and, in some places, city law or county law, sets the requirements for [[eviction]] of a tenant.  Generally, there are a limited number of reasons for which a landlord can evict his tenant before the expiration of the tenancy.  Some cities have laws establishing the maximum rent a landlord can charge, known as [[rent control]]. \n\nA [[rental agreement]], or ''lease'', is the [[contract]] defining such terms as the price paid, penalties for late payments, the length of the rental or lease, and the amount of notice required before either the landlord or tenant cancels the agreement.  In general, the landlord is responsible for repairs and maintenance, and the tenant is responsible for keeping the property clean and safe.\n\nMany landlords hire a [[property management]] company to take care of all the details of renting their property out to a tenant.  This usually includes advertising the property and showing it to prospective tenants, and then, once rented, collecting rent from the tenant and performing repairs as needed.\n\nSometimes the term \"Ghetto landlord\" is used in reference to the owner of delapadated buildings in blightened urban areas. As a result of declining demand and thus declining [[real estate prices]] these landlords were often left with completely unprofitable properties and found themselves unable to pay for renovation and the regular maintanace of their property. The situation in many American slums became so dire that landlords were know to even set their own buidlings on fire in an attempt to collect the insurance policy.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Eviction]]\n*[[Housing tenure]]\n\n==External links==\n*[http:\/\/www.rentlaw.com\/ Rentlaw.com] The National Landlord Tenant Guide.

A female landlord can either be called a ''landlady'' or simply landlord.  When a [[legal person]] is in the same position the term landlord is used.  Other terms used are '''lessor''' and '''owner'''.  The tenant can also be called a lesee or renter.  \n\nIn the [[United States]], landlord-tenant disputes are primarily governed by [[state law]] (not [[federal law]]) regarding [[property]] and [[contracts]].  State law and, in some places, city law or county law, sets the requirements for [[eviction]] of a tenant.  Generally, there are a limited number of reasons for which a landlord can evict his tenant before the expiration of the tenancy, though at the end of the lease term the rental relationship can generally be terminated without giving any reason.  Some cities have laws establishing the maximum rent a landlord can charge, known as [[rent control]], and related [[just cause eviction controls]].\n\nA [[rental agreement]], or ''lease'', is the [[contract]] defining such terms as the price paid, penalties for late payments, the length of the rental or lease, and the amount of notice required before either the landlord or tenant cancels the agreement.  In general, the landlord is responsible for repairs and maintenance, and the tenant is responsible for keeping the property clean and safe.\n\nMany landlords hire a [[property management]] company to take care of all the details of renting their property out to a tenant.  This usually includes advertising the property and showing it to prospective tenants, and then, once rented, collecting rent from the tenant and performing repairs as needed.\n\nSometimes the term \"ghetto landlord\" is used in reference to the owner of dilapidated buildings in blighted urban areas.  As a result of declining demand and declining [[real estate prices]], these landlords were often left with completely unprofitable properties and found themselves unable to pay for renovation and the regular maintanace of their property.  The situation in many American slums became so dire that landlords were known to set their own buildings on fire in an attempt to collect on the insurance policy.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Eviction]]\n*[[Housing tenure]]\n*[[Landlord politics]]\n\n==External links==\n*[http:\/\/www.tenant.net\/ Tenant Net] America's oldest and biggest tenant resource\n*[http:\/\/www.ontariotenants.ca Ontario Tenant Rights] Canada's most popular tenant resource\n*[http:\/\/www.landlord-tenant.org\/ Landlord and Tenant]:  A guide to residential lettings for both landlords and tenants\n*[http:\/\/www.goldparty.org\/landlords.html\/ landlord politics]  activities of Minneapolis Property Rights Action Committee\n*[http:\/\/www.watchdog-news.com\/ Watchdog newspaper in Minnesota] landlord-politics publication\n*[http:\/\/www.lml.co.uk\/ Buy To Let] UK landlord's find that finance is crucial to success.

In the [[United Kingdom]] the manager of a [[public house]] is also called the landlord or, more formally, as the '''licensed victualler'''.  A female landlord can either be called a ''landlady'' or simply landlord.  When a [[legal person]] is in the same position the term landlord is used.  Other terms used are '''lessor''' and '''owner''', the term '''landlady''' is used in some jurisdictions for [[female]]s.  The tenant can also be called a lesee or renter.  \n\nIn the [[United States]], landlord-tenant disputes are primarily governed by [[state law]] (not [[federal law]]) regarding [[property]] and [[contracts]].  State law and, in some places, city law or county law, sets the requirements for [[eviction]] of a tenant.  Generally, there are a limited number of reasons for which a landlord can evict his tenant before the expiration of the tenancy, though at the end of the lease term the rental relationship can generally be terminated without giving any reason.  Some cities have laws establishing the maximum rent a landlord can charge, known as [[rent control]], and related [[just cause eviction controls]].\n\nA [[rental agreement]], or ''lease'', is the [[contract]] defining such terms as the price paid, penalties for late payments, the length of the rental or lease, and the amount of notice required before either the landlord or tenant cancels the agreement.  In general, the landlord is responsible for repairs and maintenance, and the tenant is responsible for keeping the property clean and safe.\n\nMany landlords hire a [[property management]] company to take care of all the details of renting their property out to a tenant.  This usually includes advertising the property and showing it to prospective tenants, and then, once rented, collecting rent from the tenant and performing repairs as needed.\n\nSometimes the terms \"slumlord\" or \"ghetto landlord\" are used in reference to the owner of dilapidated buildings in blighted urban areas.  As a result of declining demand and declining [[real estate prices]], these landlords were often left with completely unprofitable properties and found themselves unable to pay for renovation and the regular maintanace of their property.  The situation in many American slums became so dire that landlords were known to set their own buildings on fire in an attempt to collect on the insurance policy.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Peter Rachman]], notorious slum landlord of the 1950s and 1960s.\n*[[Eviction]]\n*[[Housing tenure]]\n*[[Landlord politics]]\n\n==External links==\n*[http:\/\/www.tenant.net\/ Tenant Net] America's oldest and biggest tenant resource\n*[http:\/\/www.ontariotenants.ca Ontario Tenant Rights] Canada's most popular tenant resource\n*[http:\/\/www.landlord-tenant.org\/ Landlord and Tenant]:  A guide to residential lettings for both landlords and tenants\n*[http:\/\/www.goldparty.org\/landlords.html\/ landlord politics]  activities of Minneapolis Property Rights Action Committee\n*[http:\/\/www.watchdog-news.com\/ Watchdog newspaper in Minnesota] landlord-politics publication\n* [http:\/\/www.shla.org.uk Social Housing Law Association]\n*[http:\/\/www.ResidentialLandlord.co.uk\/ ResidentialLandlord] Free information site for UK based landlords\n*[http:\/\/www.rentlaw.com Rentlaw.com]  U.S. National Landlord Tenant Guides\n[[category:Real estate]]\n[[Category:Property law]]\n\n[[ja:\u5730\u4e3b]]\n[[zh:\u571f\u5730\u4e3b]]",

    "original": "{{ distinguish|Landlord (Drink)}}\n\nA '''landlord''', is the owner of a [[house]], [[apartment]], [[condominium]], or [[real estate]] which is [[Renting|rent]]ed or [[lease]]d to an individual or business, who is called the [[Leasehold estate|tenant]]. In the [[United Kingdom]] the manager of a [[public house]] is also called the landlord or, more formally, as the '''licensed victualler'''.  A female landlord can either be called a ''landlady'' or simply landlord.  When a [[legal person]] is in the same position the term landlord is used.  Other terms used are '''lessor''' and '''owner''', the term '''landlady''' is used in some jurisdictions for [[female]]s.  The tenant can also be called a lesee or renter.  \n\nIn the [[United States]], landlord-tenant disputes are primarily governed by [[state law]] (not [[federal law]]) regarding [[property]] and [[contracts]].  State law and, in some places, city law or county law, sets the requirements for [[eviction]] of a tenant, as well as minimum standards that a dwelling must meet (such as requirements for smoke detectors and security devices).  Generally, there are a limited number of reasons for which a landlord can evict his tenant before the expiration of the tenancy, though at the end of the lease term the rental relationship can generally be ended without giving any reason.  Some cities have laws establishing the maximum rent a landlord can charge, known as [[rent control]], and related [[just cause eviction controls]].\n\nA [[rental agreement]], or ''lease'', is the [[contract]] defining such terms as the price paid, penalties for late payments, the length of the rental or lease, and the amount of notice required before either the landlord or tenant cancels the agreement.  In general, the landlord is responsible for repairs and maintenance, and the tenant is responsible for keeping the property clean and safe.\n\nMany landlords hire a [[property management]] company to take care of all the details of renting their property out to a tenant.  This usually includes advertising the property and showing it to prospective tenants, and then, once rented, collecting rent from the tenant and performing repairs as needed.\n\nSometimes the terms \"[[slumlord]]\" or \"ghetto landlord\" are used in reference to the owner of dilapidated buildings in blighted urban areas.  As a result of declining demand and declining [[real estate prices]], these landlords were often left with completely unprofitable properties and found themselves unable to pay for renovation and the regular maintanace of their property.  The situation in many American slums became so dire that landlords were known to set their own buildings on fire in an attempt to collect on the insurance policy.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Peter Rachman]], notorious slum landlord of the 1950s and 1960s.\n*[[Eviction]]\n*[[Housing tenure]]\n*[[Landlord harassment]]\n*[[Landlord politics]]\n\n==External links==\n*[http:\/\/www.tenant.net\/ Tenant Net] America's oldest and biggest tenant resource\n*[http:\/\/www.ontariotenants.ca Ontario Tenant Rights] Canada's most popular tenant resource\n*[http:\/\/www.landlord-tenant.org\/ Landlord and Tenant]:  A guide to residential lettings for both landlords and tenants\n*[http:\/\/www.goldparty.org\/landlords.html\/ landlord politics]  activities of Minneapolis Property Rights Action Committee\n*[http:\/\/www.watchdog-news.com\/ Watchdog newspaper in Minnesota] landlord-politics publication\n* [http:\/\/www.shla.org.uk Social Housing Law Association]\n*[http:\/\/www.ResidentialLandlord.co.uk\/ ResidentialLandlord] Free information site for UK based landlords\n*[http:\/\/www.CompleteLandlord.com\/ CompleteLandlord] Free information site for US based landlords \n[[category:Real estate]]\n[[Category:Property law]]\n\n\n\n[[ja:\u5730\u4e3b]]\n[[zh:\u571f\u5730\u4e3b]]",

    "original": "{{ distinguish|Landlord (Drink)}}\n\nA '''landlord''', is the owner of a [[house]], [[apartment]], [[condominium]], or [[real estate]] which is [[Renting|rent]]ed or [[lease]]d to an individual or business, who is called the [[Leasehold estate|tenant]]. In the [[United Kingdom]] the manager of a [[public house]] is also called the landlord or, more formally, as the '''licensed victualler'''.  A female landlord can either be called a ''landlady'' or simply landlord.  When a [[legal person]] is in the same position the term landlord is used.  Other terms used are '''lessor''' and '''owner''', the term '''landlady''' is used in some jurisdictions for [[female]]s.  The tenant can also be called a lesee or renter.  \n\nIn the [[United States]], landlord-tenant disputes are primarily governed by [[state law]] (not [[federal law]]) regarding [[property]] and [[contracts]].  State law and, in some places, city law or county law, sets the requirements for [[eviction]] of a tenant.  Generally, there are a limited number of reasons for which a landlord can evict his tenant before the expiration of the tenancy, though at the end of the lease term the rental relationship can generally be terminated without giving any reason.  Some cities have laws establishing the maximum rent a landlord can charge, known as [[rent control]], and related [[just cause eviction controls]].  There is also an [[Implied_warranty_of_habitability#Habitability|implied warranty of habitability]], whereby a landlord must maintain safe, decent and habitable housing, meeting minimum safety requirements such as smoke detectors and a locking door.\n\nA [[rental agreement]], or ''lease'', is the [[contract]] defining such terms as the price paid, penalties for late payments, the length of the rental or lease, and the amount of notice required before either the landlord or tenant cancels the agreement.  In general, the landlord is responsible for repairs and maintenance, and the tenant is responsible for keeping the property clean and safe.\n\nMany landlords hire a [[property management]] company to take care of all the details of renting their property out to a tenant.  This usually includes advertising the property and showing it to prospective tenants, and then, once rented, collecting rent from the tenant and performing repairs as needed.\n\nSometimes the terms \"[[slumlord]]\" or \"ghetto landlord\" are used in reference to the owner of dilapidated buildings in blighted urban areas.  As a result of declining demand and declining [[real estate prices]], these landlords were often left with completely unprofitable properties and found themselves unable to pay for renovation and the regular maintanace of their property.  The situation in many American slums became so dire that landlords were known to set their own buildings on fire in an attempt to collect on the insurance policy.\n\nI like many people on our lovley green planet live in a rented house, my landlady (man) hates the universe and everything in it. Someone please help me, I have no oven, no microwave, a broken fridge and gammy electrics. I also pay through my nose for gas and electricity, surly this is illegal???\n\n==See also==\n*[[Peter Rachman]], notorious slum landlord of the 1950s and 1960s.\n*[[Eviction]]\n*[[Housing tenure]]\n*[[Landlord harassment]]\n*[[Landlord politics]]\n\n==External links==\n*[http:\/\/www.tenant.net\/ Tenant Net] America's oldest and biggest tenant resource\n*[http:\/\/www.ontariotenants.ca Ontario Tenant Rights] Canada's most popular tenant resource\n*[http:\/\/www.landlord-tenant.org\/ Landlord and Tenant]:  A guide to residential lettings for both landlords and tenants\n*[http:\/\/www.goldparty.org\/landlords.html\/ landlord politics]  activities of Minneapolis Property Rights Action Committee\n*[http:\/\/www.watchdog-news.com\/ Watchdog newspaper in Minnesota] landlord-politics publication\n* [http:\/\/www.shla.org.uk Social Housing Law Association]\n*[http:\/\/www.ResidentialLandlord.co.uk\/ ResidentialLandlord] Free information site for UK based landlords\n*[http:\/\/www.CompleteLandlord.com\/ CompleteLandlord] Free information site for US based landlords \n[[category:Real estate]]\n[[Category:Property law]]\n\n\n\n[[ja:\u5730\u4e3b]]\n[[zh:\u571f\u5730\u4e3b]]",

In the [[United Kingdom]] the manager of a [[public house]] is also called the landlord or, more formally, as the '''licensed victualler'''.  A female landlord can either be called a ''landlady'' or simply landlord.  When a [[legal person]] is in the same position the term landlord is used.

Generally, there are a limited number of reasons for which a landlord can evict his tenant before the expiration of the tenancy, though at the end of the lease term the rental relationship can generally be terminated without giving any reason.  Some cities have laws establishing the maximum rent a landlord can charge, known as [[rent control]], and related [[just cause eviction controls]].  There is also an [[Implied_warranty_of_habitability#Habitability|implied warranty of habitability]], whereby a landlord must maintain safe, decent and habitable housing, meeting minimum safety requirements such as smoke detectors and a locking door.\n\nA [[rental agreement]], or ''lease'', is the [[contract]] defining such terms as the price paid, penalties for late payments, the length of the rental or lease, and the amount of notice required before either the landlord or tenant cancels the agreement.  In general, the landlord is responsible for repairs and maintenance, and the tenant is responsible for keeping the property clean and safe.\n\nMany landlords hire a [[property management]] company to take care of all the details of renting their property out to a tenant.

In the [[United Kingdom]] the manager of a [[public house]] is also called the landlord or, more formally, as the '''licensed victualler'''.  A female landlord can either be called a ''landlady'' or simply landlord.  When a [[legal person]] is in the same position the term landlord is used.  Other terms used are '''lessor''' and '''owner''', the term '''landlady''' is used in some jurisdictions for [[female]]s.  The tenant can also be called a lesee or renter.  \n\nIn the [[United States]], landlord-tenant disputes are primarily governed by [[state law]] (not [[federal law]]) regarding [[property]] and [[contracts]].  State law and, in some places, city law or county law, sets the requirements for [[eviction]] of a tenant.  Generally, there are a limited number of reasons for which a landlord can evict his tenant before the expiration of the tenancy, though at the end of the lease term the rental relationship can generally be terminated without giving any reason.  Some cities have laws establishing the maximum rent a landlord can charge, known as [[rent control]], and related [[just cause eviction controls]].  There is also an [[Implied_warranty_of_habitability#Habitability|implied warranty of habitability]], whereby a landlord must maintain safe, decent and habitable housing, meeting minimum safety requirements such as smoke detectors and a locking door.\n\nA [[rental agreement]], or ''lease'', is the [[contract]] defining such terms as the price paid, penalties for late payments, the length of the rental or lease, and the amount of notice required before either the landlord or tenant cancels the agreement.  In general, the landlord is responsible for repairs and maintenance, and the tenant is responsible for keeping the property clean and safe.\n\nMany landlords hire a [[property management]] company to take care of all the details of renting their property out to a tenant.  This usually includes advertising the property and showing it to prospective tenants, and then, once rented, collecting rent from the tenant and performing repairs as needed.\n\nSometimes the terms \"[[slumlord]]\" or \"ghetto landlord\" are used in reference to the owner of dilapidated buildings in blighted urban areas.

In the [[United Kingdom]] the manager of a [[public house]] is also called the landlord or, more formally, as the '''licensed victualler'''.  A female landlord can either be called a ''landlady'' or simply landlord.  When a [[legal person]] is in the same position the term landlord is used.  Other terms used are '''lessor''' and '''owner''', the term '''landlady''' is used in some jurisdictions for [[female]]s.  The tenant can also be called a lesee or renter.  \n\nIn the [[United States]], landlord-tenant disputes are primarily governed by [[state law]] (not [[federal law]]) regarding [[property]] and [[contracts]].  State law and, in some places, city law or county law, sets the requirements for [[eviction]] of a tenant.  Generally, there are a limited number of reasons for which a landlord can evict his tenant before the expiration of the tenancy, though at the end of the lease term the rental relationship can generally be terminated without giving any reason.  Some cities have laws establishing the maximum rent a landlord can charge, known as [[rent control]], and related [[just cause eviction controls]].  There is also an [[Implied_warranty_of_habitability#Habitability|implied warranty of habitability]], whereby a landlord must maintain safe, decent and habitable housing, meeting minimum safety requirements such as smoke detectors and a locking door.\n\nA [[rental agreement]], or ''lease'', is the [[contract]] defining such terms as the price paid, penalties for late payments, the length of the rental or lease, and the amount of notice required before either the landlord or tenant cancels the agreement.  In general, the landlord is responsible for repairs and maintenance, and the tenant is responsible for keeping the property clean and safe.\n\nMany landlords hire a [[property management]] company to take care of all the details of renting their property out to a tenant.  This usually includes advertising the property and showing it to prospective tenants, and then, once rented, collecting rent from the tenant and performing repairs as needed.\n\nSometimes the terms \"[[slumlord]]\" or \"ghetto landlord\" are used in reference to the owner of dilapidated buildings in blighted urban areas.

In the [[United Kingdom]] the manager of a [[public house]] (pub) is also called the landlord or, more formally, as the '''licensed victualler'''.  A female landlord can either be called a ''landlady'' or simply landlord.  When a [[legal person]] is in the same position the term landlord is used.  Other terms used are '''lessor''' and '''owner''', the term '''landlady''' is used in some jurisdictions for [[female]]s.  The tenant can also be called a lesee or renter.  \n\nA charity called the Licensed Victualler's National Homes exists to serve the retirement needs of Britain's pub landlords. The charity also runs a private boarding school, in Ascot, Berkshire, which in addition to regular fee-paying pupils, provides discounted education prices for the children of landlords and others in the catering industry.\n\nIn the [[United States]], landlord-tenant disputes are primarily governed by [[state law]] (not [[federal law]]) regarding [[property]] and [[contracts]].  State law and, in some places, city law or county law, sets the requirements for [[eviction]] of a tenant.  Generally, there are a limited number of reasons for which a landlord can evict his tenant before the expiration of the tenancy, though at the end of the lease term the rental relationship can generally be terminated without giving any reason.  Some cities have laws establishing the maximum rent a landlord can charge, known as [[rent control]], and related [[just cause eviction controls]].  There is also an [[Implied_warranty_of_habitability#Habitability|implied warranty of habitability]], whereby a landlord must maintain safe, decent and habitable housing, meeting minimum safety requirements such as smoke detectors and a locking door.\n\nA [[rental agreement]], or ''lease'', is the [[contract]] defining such terms as the price paid, penalties for late payments, the length of the rental or lease, and the amount of notice required before either the landlord or tenant cancels the agreement.  In general, the landlord is responsible for repairs and maintenance, and the tenant is responsible for keeping the property clean and safe.\n\nMany landlords hire a [[property management]] company to take care of all the details of renting their property out to a tenant.  This usually includes advertising the property and showing it to prospective tenants, and then, once rented, collecting rent from the tenant and performing repairs as needed.\n\nSometimes the terms \"[[slumlord]]\" or \"ghetto landlord\" are used in reference to the owner of dilapidated buildings in blighted urban areas.  As a result of declining demand and declining [[real estate prices]], these landlords were often left with completely unprofitable properties and found themselves unable to pay for renovation and the regular maintenance of their property.  The situation in many American slums became so dire that landlords were known to set their own buildings on fire in an attempt to collect on the insurance policy.\n\n\n==See also==\n*[[Peter Rachman]], notorious slum landlord of the 1950s and 1960s.\n*[[Eviction]]\n*[[Housing tenure]]\n*[[Landlord harassment]]\n*[[Landlord politics]]\n\n==External links==\n{{cleanup-spam}}\n\n=\n[[category:Real estate]]\n[[Category:Real property law]]\n\n\n\n[[ja:\u5730\u4e3b]]\n[[zh:\u571f\u5730\u4e3b]]",

In the [[United Kingdom]] the manager of a [[public house]] (pub) is also called the landlord or, more formally, as the '''licensed victualler'''.  A female landlord can either be called a ''landlady'' or simply landlord.  When a [[juristic person]] is in the same position the term landlord is used.  Other terms used are '''lessor''' and '''owner''', the term '''landlady''' is used in some jurisdictions for [[female]]s.  The tenant can also be called a lesee or renter.  \n\nA charity called the Licensed Victualler's National Homes exists to serve the retirement needs of Britain's pub landlords. The charity also runs a private boarding school, in Ascot, Berkshire, which in addition to regular fee-paying pupils, provides discounted education prices for the children of landlords and others in the catering industry.\n\nIn the [[United States]], landlord-tenant disputes are primarily governed by [[state law]] (not [[federal law]]) regarding [[property]] and [[contracts]].  State law and, in some places, city law or county law, sets the requirements for [[eviction]] of a tenant.  Generally, there are a limited number of reasons for which a landlord can evict his tenant before the expiration of the tenancy, though at the end of the lease term the rental relationship can generally be terminated without giving any reason.  Some cities have laws establishing the maximum rent a landlord can charge, known as [[rent control]], and related [[just cause eviction controls]].  There is also an [[Implied_warranty_of_habitability#Habitability|implied warranty of habitability]], whereby a landlord must maintain safe, decent and habitable housing, meeting minimum safety requirements such as smoke detectors and a locking door.\n\nA [[rental agreement]], or ''lease'', is the [[contract]] defining such terms as the price paid, penalties for late payments, the length of the rental or lease, and the amount of notice required before either the landlord or tenant cancels the agreement.  In general, the landlord is responsible for repairs and maintenance, and the tenant is responsible for keeping the property clean and safe.\n\nMany landlords hire a [[property management]] company to take care of all the details of renting their property out to a tenant.  This usually includes advertising the property and showing it to prospective tenants, and then, once rented, collecting rent from the tenant and performing repairs as needed.\n\nSometimes the terms \"[[slumlord]]\" or \"ghetto landlord\" are used in reference to the owner of dilapidated buildings in blighted urban areas.  As a result of declining demand and declining [[real estate prices]], these landlords were often left with completely unprofitable properties and found themselves unable to pay for renovation and the regular maintenance of their property.  The situation in many American slums became so dire that landlords were known to set their own buildings on fire in an attempt to collect on the insurance policy.\n\n==See also==\n[http:\/\/www.pickalandlord.com] [http:\/\/www.pickalandlord.com[Pick-A-Landlord]], A place to rate and find ratings of landlords in your area.\n\n* http:\/\/www.CompleteLandlord.com\\  Free resources, articles and news for landlords\n*[[Peter Rachman]], notorious slum landlord of the 1950s and 1960s.\n*[[Eviction]]\n*[[Housing tenure]]\n*[[Landlord harassment]]\n*[http:\/\/www.landorslum.com A website where renters can review their landlords for others to see.]\n\n[[category:Real estate]]\n[[Category:Real property law]]\n\n[[ja:\u5730\u4e3b]]\n[[zh:\u571f\u5730\u4e3b]]",

In the [[United Kingdom]] the manager of a [[public house]] (pub) is also called the landlord or, more formally, as the '''licensed victualler'''.  A female landlord can either be called a ''landlady'' or simply landlord.  When a [[juristic person]] is in the same position the term landlord is used.  Other terms used are '''lessor''' and '''owner''', the term '''landlady''' is used in some jurisdictions for [[female]]s.  The tenant can also be called a lesee or renter.  \n\nA charity called the Licensed Victualler's National Homes exists to serve the retirement needs of Britain's pub landlords. The charity also runs a private boarding school, in Ascot, Berkshire, which in addition to regular fee-paying pupils, provides discounted education prices for the children of landlords and others in the catering industry.\n\nIn the [[United States]], landlord-tenant disputes are primarily governed by [[state law]] (not [[federal law]]) regarding [[property]] and [[contracts]].  State law and, in some places, city law or county law, sets the requirements for [[eviction]] of a tenant.  Generally, there are a limited number of reasons for which a landlord can evict his tenant before the expiration of the tenancy, though at the end of the lease term the rental relationship can generally be terminated without giving any reason.  Some cities have laws establishing the maximum rent a landlord can charge, known as [[rent control]], and related [[just cause eviction controls]].  There is also an [[Implied_warranty_of_habitability#Habitability|implied warranty of habitability]], whereby a landlord must maintain safe, decent and habitable housing, meeting minimum safety requirements such as smoke detectors and a locking door.\n\nA [[rental agreement]], or ''lease'', is the [[contract]] defining such terms as the price paid, penalties for late payments, the length of the rental or lease, and the amount of notice required before either the landlord or tenant cancels the agreement.  In general, the landlord is responsible for repairs and maintenance, and the tenant is responsible for keeping the property clean and safe.\n\nMany landlords hire a [[property management]] company to take care of all the details of renting their property out to a tenant.  This usually includes advertising the property and showing it to prospective tenants, and then, once rented, collecting rent from the tenant and performing repairs as needed.\n\nSometimes the terms \"[[slumlord]]\" or \"ghetto landlord\" are used in reference to the owner of dilapidated buildings in blighted urban areas.  As a result of declining demand and declining [[real estate prices]], these landlords were often left with completely unprofitable properties and found themselves unable to pay for renovation and the regular maintenance of their property.  The situation in many American slums became so dire that landlords were known to set their own buildings on fire in an attempt to collect on the insurance policy.\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[http:\/\/www.Pick-A-Landlord.com]], Landlord rating site.\n*[[Peter Rachman]], notorious slum landlord of the 1950s and 1960s.\n*[[Eviction]]\n*[[Housing tenure]]\n*[[Landlord harassment]]\n*[http:\/\/www.fairhousinghelper.com Information for landlords about compliance with discrimination laws.]\n*[http:\/\/www.landlord.co.uk Information for UK landlords.]\n[[Category:Beer and breweries in the United Kingdom]]\n[[category:Real estate]]\n[[Category:Real property law]]\n\n[[ja:\u5730\u4e3b]]\n[[zh:\u571f\u5730\u4e3b]]",

In the [[United Kingdom]] the manager of a [[public house]] (pub) is also called the landlord or, more formally, as the '''licensed victualler'''.  A female landlord can either be called a ''landlady'' or simply landlord.  When a [[juristic person]] is in the same position the term landlord is used.

The tenant can also be called a lesee or renter.  \n\nA charity called the Licensed Victualler's National Homes exists to serve the retirement needs of Britain's pub landlords.

Generally, there are a limited number of reasons for which a landlord can evict his tenant before the expiration of the tenancy, though at the end of the lease term the rental relationship can generally be terminated without giving any reason.  Some cities have laws establishing the maximum rent a landlord can charge, known as [[rent control]], and related [[just cause eviction controls]].  There is also an [[Implied_warranty_of_habitability#Habitability|implied warranty of habitability]], whereby a landlord must maintain safe, decent and habitable housing, meeting minimum safety requirements such as smoke detectors and a locking door.\n\nA [[rental agreement]], or ''lease'', is the [[contract]] defining such terms as the price paid, penalties for late payments, the length of the rental or lease, and the amount of notice required before either the landlord or tenant cancels the agreement.

In the [[United Kingdom]] the manager of a [[public house]] (pub) is also called the landlord or, more formally, as the '''licensed victualler'''.  A female landlord can either be called a ''landlady'' or simply landlord.  When a [[juristic person]] is in the same position the term landlord is used.

Generally, there are a limited number of reasons for which a landlord can evict his tenant before the expiration of the tenancy, though at the end of the lease term the rental relationship can generally be terminated without giving any reason.  Some cities have laws establishing the maximum rent a landlord can charge, known as [[rent control]], and related [[just cause eviction controls]].  There is also an [[Implied_warranty_of_habitability#Habitability|implied warranty of habitability]], whereby a landlord must maintain safe, decent and habitable housing, meeting minimum safety requirements such as smoke detectors and a locking door.\n\nA [[rental agreement]], or ''lease'', is the [[contract]] defining such terms as the price paid, penalties for late payments, the length of the rental or lease, and the amount of notice required before either the landlord or tenant cancels the agreement.

    "original": "{{ distinguish|Landlord (beer)}}\n\nA '''landlord''', is the owner of a [[house]], [[apartment]], [[condominium]], or [[real estate]] which is [[Renting|rent]]ed or [[lease]]d to an individual or business, who is called the [[Leasehold estate|tenant]].   When a [[juristic person]] is in the same position the term landlord is used.  Other terms used are '''lessor''' and '''owner''', the term '''landlady''' is used in some jurisdictions for [[female]]s.  The tenant can also be called a lesee or renter.  \n\nIn the [[United States]], landlord-tenant disputes are primarily governed by [[state law]] (not [[federal law]]) regarding [[property]] and [[contracts]].  State law and, in some places, city law or county law, sets the requirements for [[eviction]] of a tenant.  Generally, there are a limited number of reasons for which a landlord can evict his tenant before the expiration of the tenancy, though at the end of the lease term the rental relationship can generally be terminated without giving any reason.  Some cities have laws establishing the maximum rent a landlord can charge, known as [[rent control]], and related [[just cause eviction controls]].  There is also an [[Implied_warranty_of_habitability#Habitability|implied warranty of habitability]], whereby a landlord must maintain safe, decent and habitable housing, meeting minimum safety requirements such as smoke detectors and a locking door.\n\nA [[rental agreement]], or ''lease'', is the [[contract]] defining such terms as the price paid, penalties for late payments, the length of the rental or lease, and the amount of notice required before either the landlord or tenant cancels the agreement.  In general, the landlord is responsible for repairs and maintenance, and the tenant is responsible for keeping the property clean and safe.\n\nMany landlords hire a [[property management]] company to take care of all the details of renting their property out to a tenant.  This usually includes advertising the property and showing it to prospective tenants, and then, once rented, collecting rent from the tenant and performing repairs as needed.\n\nSometimes the terms \"[[slumlord]]\" or \"ghetto landlord\" are used in reference to the owner of dilapidated buildings in blighted urban areas.  As a result of declining demand and declining [[real estate prices]], these landlords were often left with completely unprofitable properties and found themselves unable to pay for renovation and the regular maintenance of their property.  The situation in many American slums became so dire that landlords were known to set their own buildings on fire in an attempt to collect on the insurance policy.\n\n==Licensed victualler==\n{{Main|Public house}}\n\nIn the [[United Kingdom]] the owner and\/or manager of a [[public house]] (pub) is also called the \"landlord\", \"publican\", or \"licensee\". The more formally term is '''licensed victualler'''.  A female landlord can either be called a ''landlady'' or simply landlord.\n\nA charity called the Licensed Victualler's National Homes exists to serve the retirement needs of Britain's pub landlords.

State law and, in some places, city law or county law, sets the requirements for [[eviction]] of a tenant.  Generally, there are a limited number of reasons for which a landlord can evict his or her tenant before the expiration of the tenancy, though at the end of the lease term the rental relationship can generally be terminated without giving any reason.  Some cities have laws establishing the maximum rent a landlord can charge, known as [[rent control]], and related [[just cause eviction controls]].  There is also an [[Implied_warranty_of_habitability#Habitability|implied warranty of habitability]], whereby a landlord must maintain safe, decent and habitable housing, meeting minimum safety requirements such as smoke detectors and a locking door.\n\nA [[rental agreement]], or ''lease'', is the [[contract]] defining such terms as the price paid, penalties for late payments, the length of the rental or lease, and the amount of notice required before either the landlord or tenant cancels the agreement.  In general, the landlord is responsible for repairs and maintenance, and the tenant is responsible for keeping the property clean and safe.\n\nMany landlords hire a [[property management]] company to take care of all the details of renting their property out to a tenant.  This usually includes advertising the property and showing it to prospective tenants, and then, once rented, collecting rent from the tenant and performing repairs as needed.\n\nSometimes the terms \"[[slumlord]]\" or \"ghetto landlord\" are used in reference to the owner of dilapidated buildings in blighted urban areas.  As a result of declining demand and declining [[real estate prices]], these landlords were often left with completely unprofitable properties and found themselves unable to pay for renovation and the regular maintenance of their property.

    "original": "{{ distinguish|Landlord (beer)}}\n\n'''Landlord''' is the owner of a [[house]], [[apartment]], [[condominium]], or [[real estate]] which is [[Renting|rent]]ed or [[lease]]d to an individual or business, who is called [[Leasehold estate|tenant]] (also a ''lesee'' or ''renter'').  When a [[juristic person]] is in this position the term landlord is used.  Other terms include '''lessor''' and '''owner''', the term '''landlady''' is used in some jurisdictions for the [[female]] owners, otherwise landlady can still be called landlord.  \n\n== History of landlording ==\n''See also  [[Tenement (law)|Tenement]].''\n\nLandlording may be traced back to the Roman Empire and the manorial system ([[seignorialism]]), which began under it - peasants were bound to the land and dependent on their landlords for protection and justice. Under the [[feudalism]] such relations became widespread.<ref>[http:\/\/www.landlordzone.co.uk\/history.htm \"Landlording\" A History]<\/ref> \n\n== Landlord and tenant ==\n\nThe two parties step into relationship under the law of real estate property by signing a contract called lease.

    "original": "{{ distinguish|Landlord (beer)}}\n\n'''Landlord''' is the owner of a [[house]], [[apartment]], [[condominium]], or [[real estate]] which is [[Renting|rent]]ed or [[lease]]d to an individual or business, who is called [[Leasehold estate|tenant]] (also a ''lesee'' or ''renter'').  When a [[juristic person]] is in this position the term landlord is used.  Other terms include '''lessor''' and '''owner''', the term '''landlady''' is used in some jurisdictions for the [[female]] owners, otherwise landlady can still be called landlord.  \n\n== History of landlording ==\n''See also  [[Tenement (law)|Tenement]].''\n\nLandlording may be traced back to the Roman Empire and the manorial system ([[seignorialism]]), which began under it - peasants were bound to the land and dependent on their landlords for protection and justice. Under the [[feudalism]] such relations became widespread.<ref>[http:\/\/www.landlordzone.co.uk\/history.htm \"Landlording\" A History]<\/ref> \n\n== Landlord and tenant ==\n\nThe two parties step into relationship under the law of real estate property by signing a contract called lease. With this contract the one party, which has superior title to the property, ie the landlord, grads possession and use of it for a limited period to the other party, ie the tenant. The landlord may not be the actual owner of the property but keeping in some way the right to sub-lease.\n\nA [[rental agreement]], or ''lease'', is the [[contract]] defining such terms as the price paid, penalties for late payments, the length of the rental or lease, and the amount of notice required before either the landlord or tenant cancels the agreement.  In general, responsibilities are given as follow: the landlord is responsible for making repairments and property maintenance, and the tenant is responsible for keeping the property clean and safe.\n\nMany landlords hire a [[property management]] company to take care of all the details of renting their property out to a tenant. This usually includes advertising the property and showing it to prospective tenants, and then, once rented, collecting rent from the tenant and performing repairs as needed.\n\n[[Image:E9438-David-Berry-monument.jpg|thumb|Being a good landlord, [[David Berry]] (who had owned much of what is now known as [[Berry, New South Wales|Berry - the town was named after him]]) is well remembered by his tenants.]]\n\nIn the [[United States]], landlord-tenant disputes are primarily governed by [[state law]] (not [[federal law]]) regarding [[property]] and [[contracts]].  State law and, in some places, city law or county law, sets the requirements for [[eviction]] of a tenant.  Generally, there are a limited number of reasons for which a landlord can evict his or her tenant before the expiration of the tenancy, though at the end of the lease term the rental relationship can generally be terminated without giving any reason. Some cities have laws establishing the maximum rent a landlord can charge, known as [[rent control]], and related [[just cause eviction controls]]. There is also an [[Implied_warranty_of_habitability#Habitability|implied warranty of habitability]], whereby a landlord must maintain safe, decent and habitable housing, meeting minimum safety requirements such as smoke detectors and a locking door.\n\nSometimes the terms \"[[slumlord]]\" or \"ghetto landlord\" are used in reference to the owner of dilapidated buildings in blighted urban areas. As a result of declining demand and declining [[real estate prices]], these landlords were often left with completely unprofitable properties and found themselves unable to pay for renovation and the regular maintenance of their property. The situation in many American slums became so dire that some landlords were convicted of [[arson]] after they arranged to have their own buildings set on fire in an attempt to collect on the insurance policy.\n\nAside of bad or leading to lawsuits relations between landlord and tenant, these relations as written and shown by Robert Burns (1759 - 1796) may keep warmth and mutual delight.\n\n{{Quotation|The landlady and Tam grew gracious&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\nWi' favours secret, sweet, and precious.|[[Robert Burns]]||\"Tam o' Shanter\", 1791. \t\n}}\n\n==Licensed victualler==\n{{Main|Public house}}\n\nIn the [[United Kingdom]] the owner and\/or manager of a [[public house]] (pub) is also called the \"landlord\", \"publican\", or \"licensee\". In a more formal way the term used is '''licensed victualler'''. A female landlord can either be called a ''landlady'' or simply landlord.\n\nA charity called the Licensed Victualler's National Homes exists to serve the retirement needs of Britain's pub landlords. The charity also runs a private boarding school, in Ascot, Berkshire, which in addition to regular fee-paying pupils, provides discounted education prices for the children of landlords and others in the catering industry.\n\n== Notes ==\n<references\/>\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[Anti-Rent War]]\n*[[Absentee landlord]]\n*[[Eviction]]\n*[[Housing tenure]]\n*[[Land tenure]]\n*[[Landlords insurance]]\n*[[Landlord harassment]]\n*[[Sachenspiegel|Landrecht]]\n*[[Peter Rachman]], notorious slum landlord of the 1950s and 1960s.\n\n{{wiktionary|Landlord}}\n\n\n[[Category:Real estate]]\n[[Category:Real property law]]\n\n[[ja:\u5730\u4e3b]]\n[[ru:\u041f\u043e\u043c\u0435\u0449\u0438\u043a]]\n[[zh:\u571f\u5730\u4e3b]]",

    "original": "{{for|the ale brand called Landlord|Landlord (beer)}}\n{{Refimprove|date=March 2008}}\n'''Landlord''' is the owner of a [[house]], [[apartment]], [[condominium]], or [[real estate]] which is [[Renting|rent]]ed or [[lease]]d to an individual or business, who is called a [[Leasehold estate|tenant]] (also a ''lessee'' or ''renter'').  When a [[juristic person]] is in this position, the term landlord is used. Other terms include '''lessor''' and '''owner'''. The term '''landlady''' may be used in some jurisdictions for [[female]] owners, but landlord can apply to both genders. \n\n== History of landlording ==\n''See also  [[Tenement (law)|Tenement]].''\n\nLandlording may be traced back to the Roman Empire and the manorial system ([[seignorialism]]), which began under it \u2014 peasants were bound to the land and dependent on their landlords for protection and justice. Under the [[feudalism]] such relations became widespread.\n\n== Landlord and tenant ==\n\nThe two parties step into relationship under the law of real estate property by signing a contract called lease. With this contract the one party, which has superior title to the property, ie the landlord, grants possession and use of it for a limited period to the other party, ie the tenant. The landlord may not be the actual owner of the property but keeping in some way the right to sub-lease.\n\nA [[rental agreement]], or ''lease'', is the [[contract]] defining such terms as the price paid, penalties for late payments, the length of the rental or lease, and the amount of notice required before either the landlord or tenant cancels the agreement.  In general, responsibilities are given as follow: the landlord is responsible for making repairments and property maintenance, and the tenant is responsible for keeping the property clean and safe.\n\nMany landlords hire a [[property management]] company to take care of all the details of renting their property out to a tenant. This usually includes advertising the property and showing it to prospective tenants, and then, once rented, collecting rent from the tenant and performing repairs as needed.\n\n[[Image:E9438-David-Berry-monument.jpg|thumb|Being a good landlord, [[David Berry]] (who had owned much of what is now known as [[Berry, New South Wales|Berry - the town was named after him]]) is well remembered by his tenants.]]\n\nIn the [[United States]], landlord-tenant disputes are primarily governed by [[state law]] (not [[federal law]]) regarding [[property]] and [[contracts]].  State law and, in some places, city law or county law, sets the requirements for [[eviction]] of a tenant.  Generally, there are a limited number of reasons for which a landlord can evict his or her tenant before the expiration of the tenancy, though at the end of the lease term the rental relationship can generally be terminated without giving any reason. Some cities have laws establishing the maximum rent a landlord can charge, known as [[rent control]], and related [[just cause eviction controls]]. There is also an [[Implied_warranty_of_habitability#Habitability|implied warranty of habitability]], whereby a landlord must maintain safe, decent and habitable housing, meeting minimum safety requirements such as smoke detectors and a locking door.\n\nSometimes the terms \"[[slumlord]]\" or \"ghetto landlord\" are used in reference to the owner of dilapidated buildings in blighted urban areas. As a result of declining demand and declining [[real estate prices]], these landlords were often left with completely unprofitable properties and found themselves unable to pay for renovation and the regular maintenance of their property. The situation in many American slums became so dire that some landlords were convicted of [[arson]] after they arranged to have their own buildings set on fire in an attempt to collect on the insurance policies.\n\nAside of bad or leading to lawsuits relations between landlord and tenant, these relations as written and shown by Robert Burns (1759 - 1796) may keep warmth and mutual delight.\n\n{{Quotation\n|The landlady and Tam grew gracious <br> Wi' favours secret, sweet, and precious.\n|[[Robert Burns]]\n|\"Tam o' Shanter\", 1791. \t\n}}\n\n==Licensed victualler==\n{{Main|Public house}}\n\nIn the [[United Kingdom]] the owner and\/or manager of a [[public house]] (pub) is also called the \"landlord\", \"publican\", or \"licensee\".

    "original": "{{for|the ale brand called Landlord|Landlord (beer)}}\n{{Refimprove|date=March 2008}}\n'''Landlord''' is the owner of a [[house]], [[apartment]], [[condominium]], or [[real estate]] which is [[Renting|rent]]ed or [[lease]]d to an individual or business, who is called a [[Leasehold estate|tenant]] (also a ''lessee'' or ''renter'').  When a [[juristic person]] is in this position, the term landlord is used. Other terms include '''lessor''' and '''owner'''. The term '''landlady''' may be used in some jurisdictions for [[female]] owners, but landlord can apply to both genders. \n\n== History of landlording ==\n''See also  [[Tenement (law)|Tenement]].''\n\nLandlording may be traced back to the Roman Empire and the manorial system ([[seignorialism]]), which began under it \u2014 peasants were bound to the land and dependent on their landlords for protection and justice. Under the [[feudalism]] such relations became widespread.\nIn medieval times, landlords were more like Gods.  Upon both parties signing rental agreements it was normal for tenants to provide their new landlord with first month's rent, last month's rent, and the stewed flesh of a newborn child.  The tenants would bow and worship at the landlord's feet as he accepted their money and tasted the stewed baby.  It was customary for the landlord to then roar like a lion as he handed over the keys to the rental unit.  In some areas is was common for the landlord to defecate in the middle of the rental on every Sabbath so the tenants would make no mistake about who was the rightful owner of the property.  \n\n== Landlord and tenant ==\n\nThe two parties step into relationship under the law of real estate property by signing a contract called lease. With this contract the one party, which has superior title to the property, ie the landlord, grants possession and use of it for a limited period to the other party, ie the tenant. The landlord may not be the actual owner of the property but keeping in some way the right to sub-lease.\n\nA [[rental agreement]], or ''lease'', is the [[contract]] defining such terms as the price paid, penalties for late payments, the length of the rental or lease, and the amount of notice required before either the landlord or tenant cancels the agreement.  In general, responsibilities are given as follow: the landlord is responsible for making repairments and property maintenance, and the tenant is responsible for keeping the property clean and safe.\n\nMany landlords hire a [[property management]] company to take care of all the details of renting their property out to a tenant. This usually includes advertising the property and showing it to prospective tenants, and then, once rented, collecting rent from the tenant and performing repairs as needed.\n\n[[Image:E9438-David-Berry-monument.jpg|thumb|Being a good landlord, [[David Berry]] (who had owned much of what is now known as [[Berry, New South Wales|Berry - the town was named after him]]) is well remembered by his tenants.]]\n\nIn the [[United States]], landlord-tenant disputes are primarily governed by [[state law]] (not [[federal law]]) regarding [[property]] and [[contracts]].  State law and, in some places, city law or county law, sets the requirements for [[eviction]] of a tenant.  Generally, there are a limited number of reasons for which a landlord can evict his or her tenant before the expiration of the tenancy, though at the end of the lease term the rental relationship can generally be terminated without giving any reason. Some cities have laws establishing the maximum rent a landlord can charge, known as [[rent control]], and related [[just cause eviction controls]]. There is also an [[Implied_warranty_of_habitability#Habitability|implied warranty of habitability]], whereby a landlord must maintain safe, decent and habitable housing, meeting minimum safety requirements such as smoke detectors and a locking door.\n\nSometimes the terms \"[[slumlord]]\" or \"ghetto landlord\" are used in reference to the owner of dilapidated buildings in blighted urban areas. As a result of declining demand and declining [[real estate prices]], these landlords were often left with completely unprofitable properties and found themselves unable to pay for renovation and the regular maintenance of their property. The situation in many American slums became so dire that some landlords were convicted of [[arson]] after they arranged to have their own buildings set on fire in an attempt to collect on the insurance policies.\n\nAside of bad or leading to lawsuits relations between landlord and tenant, these relations as written and shown by Robert Burns (1759 - 1796) may keep warmth and mutual delight.\n\n{{Quotation\n|The landlady and Tam grew gracious <br> Wi' favours secret, sweet, and precious.\n|[[Robert Burns]]\n|\"Tam o' Shanter\", 1791. \t\n}}\n\n==Licensed victualler==\n{{Main|Public house}}\n\nIn the [[United Kingdom]] the owner and\/or manager of a [[public house]] (pub) is also called the \"landlord\", \"publican\", or \"licensee\". In a more formal way the term used is '''licensed victualler'''.<ref name='Dictionary.com'> {{cite web|url=http:\/\/dictionary.reference.com\/browse\/victualler |title=entry for victualler on Dictionary.com |accessdate=2008-07-19 }}<\/ref> A female landlord can either be called a ''landlady'' or simply landlord.\n\nThe [[Licensed Trade Charity]], formed in 2004 from the merger of the Society of Licensed Victuallers and Licensed Victualler's National Homes,<ref>{{EW charity|230011|Society of Licensed Victuallers}}<\/ref> exists to serve the retirement needs of Britain's pub landlords. The charity also runs a private boarding school, in Ascot, Berkshire, which in addition to regular fee-paying pupils, provides discounted education prices for the children of landlords and others in the catering industry.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Anti-Rent War]]\n*[[Absentee landlord]]\n*[[Eviction]]\n*[[Housing tenure]]\n*[[Land tenure]]\n*[[Land ownership and tenure]]\n*[[Landed gentry]]\n*[[Landed nobility]]\n*[[Landed property]]\n*[[Landlords insurance]]\n*[[Landlord harassment]]\n*[[Sachenspiegel|Landrecht]]\n*[[Peter Rachman]], notorious slum landlord of the 1950s and 1960s.\n\n==References==\n{{wiktionary|Landlord}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n\n[[Category:Real estate]]\n[[Category:Real property law]]\n\n[[gd:Uachdaran]]\n[[ka:\u10db\u10d4\u10db\u10d0\u10db\u10e3\u10da\u10d4\u10d4\u10d1\u10d8]]\n[[ja:\u5730\u4e3b]]\n[[ru:\u041f\u043e\u043c\u0435\u0449\u0438\u043a]]\n[[sv:Hyresv\u00e4rd]]\n[[zh:\u571f\u5730\u4e3b]]",

    "original": "{{for|the ale brand called Landlord|Landlord (beer)}}\n{{Refimprove|date=March 2008}}\n'''Landlord''' is the owner of a [[house]], [[apartment]], [[condominium]], or [[real estate]] which is [[Renting|rent]]ed or [[lease]]d to an individual or business, who is called a [[Leasehold estate|tenant]] (also a ''lessee'' or ''renter'').  When a [[juristic person]] is in this position, the term landlord is used. Other terms include '''lessor''' and '''owner'''. The term '''landlady''' may be used in some jurisdictions for [[female]] owners, but landlord can apply to both genders. \n\n== History of landlording ==\n''See also  [[Tenement (law)|Tenement]].''\n\nLandlording may be traced back to the Roman Empire and the manorial system ([[seignorialism]]), which began under it \u2014 peasants were bound to the land and dependent on their landlords for protection and justice. Under the [[feudalism]] such relations became widespread.\n\n== Landlord and tenant ==\n\nThe two parties step into relationship under the law of real estate property by signing a contract called lease. With this contract the one party, which has superior title to the property, ie the landlord, grants possession and use of it for a limited period to the other party, ie the tenant. The landlord may not be the actual owner of the property but keeping in some way the right to sub-lease.\n\nA [[rental agreement]], or ''lease'', is the [[contract]] defining such terms as the price paid, penalties for late payments, the length of the rental or lease, and the amount of notice required before either the landlord or tenant cancels the agreement.  In general, responsibilities are given as follow: the landlord is responsible for making repairments and property maintenance, and the tenant is responsible for keeping the property clean and safe.\n\nMany landlords hire a [[property management]] company to take care of all the details of renting their property out to a tenant. This usually includes advertising the property and showing it to prospective tenants, and then, once rented, collecting rent from the tenant and performing repairs as needed.\n\n[[Image:E9438-David-Berry-monument.jpg|thumb|Being a good landlord, David Berry (who had owned much of what is now known as [[Berry, New South Wales|Berry - the town was named after him]]) is well remembered by his tenants.]]\n\nIn the [[United States]], landlord-tenant disputes are primarily governed by [[state law]] (not [[federal law]]) regarding [[property]] and [[contracts]].  State law and, in some places, city law or county law, sets the requirements for [[eviction]] of a tenant.  Generally, there are a limited number of reasons for which a landlord can evict his or her tenant before the expiration of the tenancy, though at the end of the lease term the rental relationship can generally be terminated without giving any reason. Some cities have laws establishing the maximum rent a landlord can charge, known as [[rent control]], and related [[just cause eviction controls]]. There is also an [[Implied_warranty_of_habitability#Habitability|implied warranty of habitability]], whereby a landlord must maintain safe, decent and habitable housing, meeting minimum safety requirements such as smoke detectors and a locking door.\n\nSometimes the terms \"[[slumlord]]\" or \"ghetto landlord\" are used in reference to the owner of dilapidated buildings in blighted urban areas. As a result of declining demand and declining [[real estate prices]], these landlords were often left with completely unprofitable properties and found themselves unable to pay for renovation and the regular maintenance of their property.

    "original": "{{for|the ale brand called Landlord|Landlord (beer)}}\n{{Refimprove|date=March 2008}}\n'''Landlord''' is the owner of a [[house]], [[apartment]], [[condominium]], or [[real estate]] which is [[Renting|rent]]ed or [[lease]]d to an individual or business, who is called a [[Leasehold estate|tenant]] (also a ''lessee'' or ''renter'').  When a [[juristic person]] is in this position, the term landlord is used. Other terms include '''lessor''' and '''owner'''. The term '''landlady''' may be used in some jurisdictions for [[female]] owners, but landlord can apply to both genders. \n\n== History of landlording ==\n''See also  [[Tenement (law)|Tenement]].''\n\nLandlording may be traced back to the Roman Empire and the manorial system ([[seignorialism]]), which began under it \u2014 peasants were bound to the land and dependent on their landlords for protection and justice. Under the [[feudalism]] such relations became widespread.\nIn medieval times, landlords were more like Gods.  Upon both parties signing rental agreements it was normal for tenants to provide their new landlord with first month's rent, last month's rent, and the stewed flesh of a newborn child.  The tenants would bow and worship at the landlord's feet as he accepted their money and tasted the stewed baby.  It was customary for the landlord to then roar like a lion as he handed over the keys to the rental unit.  In some areas is was common for the landlord to defecate in the middle of the rental on every Sabbath so the tenants would make no mistake about who was the rightful owner of the property.  \n\n== Landlord and tenant ==\n\nThe two parties step into relationship under the law of real estate property by signing a contract called lease. With this contract the one party, which has superior title to the property, ie the landlord, grants possession and use of it for a limited period to the other party, ie the tenant. The landlord may not be the actual owner of the property but keeping in some way the right to sub-lease.\n\nA [[rental agreement]], or ''lease'', is the [[contract]] defining such terms as the price paid, penalties for late payments, the length of the rental or lease, and the amount of notice required before either the landlord or tenant cancels the agreement.  In general, responsibilities are given as follow: the landlord is responsible for making repairments and property maintenance, and the tenant is responsible for keeping the property clean and safe.\n\nMany landlords hire a [[property management]] company to take care of all the details of renting their property out to a tenant. This usually includes advertising the property and showing it to prospective tenants, and then, once rented, collecting rent from the tenant and performing repairs as needed.\n\n[[Image:E9438-David-Berry-monument.jpg|thumb|Being a good landlord, [[David Berry]] (who had owned much of what is now known as [[Berry, New South Wales|Berry - the town was named after him]]) is well remembered by his tenants.]]\n\nIn the [[United States]], landlord-tenant disputes are primarily governed by [[state law]] (not [[federal law]]) regarding [[property]] and [[contracts]].  State law and, in some places, city law or county law, sets the requirements for [[eviction]] of a tenant.  Generally, there are a limited number of reasons for which a landlord can evict his or her tenant before the expiration of the tenancy, though at the end of the lease term the rental relationship can generally be terminated without giving any reason. Some cities have laws establishing the maximum rent a landlord can charge, known as [[rent control]], and related [[just cause eviction controls]]. There is also an [[Implied_warranty_of_habitability#Habitability|implied warranty of habitability]], whereby a landlord must maintain safe, decent and habitable housing, meeting minimum safety requirements such as smoke detectors and a locking door.\n\nSometimes the terms \"[[slumlord]]\" or \"ghetto landlord\" are used in reference to the owner of dilapidated buildings in blighted urban areas. As a result of declining demand and declining [[real estate prices]], these landlords were often left with completely unprofitable properties and found themselves unable to pay for renovation and the regular maintenance of their property. The situation in many American slums became so dire that some landlords were convicted of [[arson]] after they arranged to have their own buildings set on fire in an attempt to collect on the insurance policies.\n\nAside of bad or leading to lawsuits relations between landlord and tenant, these relations as written and shown by Robert Burns (1759 - 1796) may keep warmth and mutual delight.\n\n{{Quotation\n|The landlady and Tam grew gracious <br> Wi' favours secret, sweet, and precious.\n|[[Robert Burns]]\n|\"Tam o' Shanter\", 1791. \t\n}}\n\n==Licensed victualler==\n{{Main|Public house}}\n\nIn the [[United Kingdom]] the owner and\/or manager of a [[public house]] (pub) is also called the \"landlord\", \"publican\", or \"licensee\". In a more formal way the term used is '''licensed victualler'''.<ref name='Dictionary.com'> {{cite web|url=http:\/\/dictionary.reference.com\/browse\/victualler |title=entry for victualler on Dictionary.com |accessdate=2008-07-19 }}<\/ref> A female landlord can either be called a ''landlady'' or simply landlord.\n\nThe [[Licensed Trade Charity]], formed in 2004 from the merger of the Society of Licensed Victuallers and Licensed Victualler's National Homes,<ref>{{EW charity|230011|Society of Licensed Victuallers}}<\/ref> exists to serve the retirement needs of Britain's pub landlords. The charity also runs a private boarding school, in Ascot, Berkshire, which in addition to regular fee-paying pupils, provides discounted education prices for the children of landlords and others in the catering industry.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Anti-Rent War]]\n*[[Absentee landlord]]\n*[[Eviction]]\n*[[Housing tenure]]\n*[[Land tenure]]\n*[[Land ownership and tenure]]\n*[[Landed gentry]]\n*[[Landed nobility]]\n*[[Landed property]]\n*[[Landlords insurance]]\n*[[Landlord harassment]]\n*[[Sachenspiegel|Landrecht]]\n*[[Peter Rachman]], notorious slum landlord of the 1950s and 1960s.\n\n==References==\n{{wiktionary|Landlord}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n\n[[Category:Real estate]]\n[[Category:Real property law]]\n\n[[gd:Uachdaran]]\n[[ka:\u10db\u10d4\u10db\u10d0\u10db\u10e3\u10da\u10d4\u10d4\u10d1\u10d8]]\n[[ja:\u5730\u4e3b]]\n[[ru:\u041f\u043e\u043c\u0435\u0449\u0438\u043a]]\n[[sv:Hyresv\u00e4rd]]\n[[zh:\u571f\u5730\u4e3b]]",

    "original": "{{for|the ale brand called Landlord|Landlord (beer)}}\n{{Refimprove|date=March 2008}}\n'''Landlord''' is the owner of a [[house]], [[apartment]], [[condominium]], or [[real estate]] which is [[Renting|rent]]ed or [[lease]]d to an individual or business, who is called a [[Leasehold estate|tenant]] (also a ''lessee'' or ''renter'').  When a [[juristic person]] is in this position, the term landlord is used. Other terms include '''lessor''' and '''owner'''. The term '''landlady''' may be used in some jurisdictions for [[female]] owners, but landlord can apply to both genders. \n\n== History of landlording ==\n''See also  [[Tenement (law)|Tenement]].''\n\nLandlording may be traced back to the Roman Empire and the manorial system ([[seignorialism]]), which began under it \u2014 peasants were bound to the land and dependent on their landlords for protection and justice. Under the [[feudalism]] such relations became widespread.\n\n== Landlord and tenant ==\n\nThe two parties step into relationship under the law of real estate property by signing a contract called lease. With this contract the one party, which has superior title to the property, ie the landlord, grants possession and use of it for a limited period to the other party, ie the tenant. The landlord may not be the actual owner of the property but keeping in some way the right to sub-lease.\n\nA [[rental agreement]], or ''lease'', is the [[contract]] defining such terms as the price paid, penalties for late payments, the length of the rental or lease, and the amount of notice required before either the landlord or tenant cancels the agreement.  In general, responsibilities are given as follow: the landlord is responsible for making repairments and property maintenance, and the tenant is responsible for keeping the property clean and safe.\n\nMany landlords hire a [[property management]] company to take care of all the details of renting their property out to a tenant. This usually includes advertising the property and showing it to prospective tenants, and then, once rented, collecting rent from the tenant and performing repairs as needed.\n\n[[Image:E9438-David-Berry-monument.jpg|thumb|Being a good landlord, David Berry (who had owned much of what is now known as [[Berry, New South Wales|Berry - the town was named after him]]) is well remembered by his tenants.]]\n\nIn the [[United States]], landlord-tenant disputes are primarily governed by [[state law]] (not [[federal law]]) regarding [[property]] and [[contracts]].  State law and, in some places, city law or county law, sets the requirements for [[eviction]] of a tenant.  Generally, there are a limited number of reasons for which a landlord can evict his or her tenant before the expiration of the tenancy, though at the end of the lease term the rental relationship can generally be terminated without giving any reason. Some cities have laws establishing the maximum rent a landlord can charge, known as [[rent control]], and related [[just cause eviction controls]]. There is also an [[Implied_warranty_of_habitability#Habitability|implied warranty of habitability]], whereby a landlord must maintain safe, decent and habitable housing, meeting minimum safety requirements such as smoke detectors and a locking door.\n\nSometimes the terms \"[[slumlord]]\" or \"ghetto landlord\" are used in reference to the owner of dilapidated buildings in blighted urban areas. As a result of declining demand and declining [[real estate prices]], these landlords were often left with completely unprofitable properties and found themselves unable to pay for renovation and the regular maintenance of their property. The situation in many American slums became so dire that some landlords were convicted of [[arson]] after they arranged to have their own buildings set on fire in an attempt to collect on the insurance policies.\n\nAside of bad or leading to lawsuits relations between landlord and tenant, these relations as written and shown by Robert Burns (1759 - 1796) may keep warmth and mutual delight.\n\n{{Quotation\n|The landlady and Tam grew gracious <br> Wi' favours secret, sweet, and precious.\n|[[Robert Burns]]\n|\"Tam o' Shanter\", 1791. \t\n}}\n\n==Licensed victualler==\n{{Main|Public house}}\n\nIn the [[United Kingdom]] the owner and\/or manager of a [[public house]] (pub) is also called the \"landlord\", \"publican\", or \"licensee\". In a more formal way the term used is '''licensed victualler'''.<ref name='Dictionary.com'> {{cite web|url=http:\/\/dictionary.reference.com\/browse\/victualler |title=entry for victualler on Dictionary.com |accessdate=2008-07-19 }}<\/ref> A female landlord can either be called a ''landlady'' or simply landlord.\n\nThe [[Licensed Trade Charity]], formed in 2004 from the merger of the Society of Licensed Victuallers and Licensed Victualler's National Homes,<ref>{{EW charity|230011|Society of Licensed Victuallers}}<\/ref> exists to serve the retirement needs of Britain's pub landlords. The charity also runs three private schools in [[Ascot, Berkshire|Ascot]] and [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]] in [[Berkshire]] and [[Sayers Common]] in [[Sussex]]. As well as having normal full fee paying students, [[Licensed Victuallers' School]] in Ascot provides discounted education prices for the children of landlords and others in the catering industry.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Anti-Rent War]]\n*[[Absentee landlord]]\n*[[Eviction]]\n*[[Housing tenure]]\n*[[Land tenure]]\n*[[Land ownership and tenure]]\n*[[Landed gentry]]\n*[[Landed nobility]]\n*[[Landed property]]\n*[[Landlords insurance]]\n*[[Landlord harassment]]\n*[[Sachenspiegel|Landrecht]]\n*[[Peter Rachman]], notorious slum landlord of the 1950s and 1960s.\n*[[Slumlord]]\n\n==References==\n{{wiktionary|Landlord}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n\n[[Category:Real estate]]\n[[Category:Real property law]]\n\n[[be-x-old:\u0410\u0431\u0448\u0430\u0440\u043d\u0456\u043a]]\n[[gd:Uachdaran]]\n[[ka:\u10db\u10d4\u10db\u10d0\u10db\u10e3\u10da\u10d4\u10d4\u10d1\u10d8]]\n[[ja:\u5730\u4e3b]]\n[[ru:\u041f\u043e\u043c\u0435\u0449\u0438\u043a]]\n[[simple:Landlord]]\n[[sv:Hyresv\u00e4rd]]\n[[zh:\u571f\u5730\u4e3b]]",

When a [[juristic person]] is in this position, the term landlord is used. Other terms include '''lessor''' and '''owner'''. The term '''landlady''' may be used in some jurisdictions for [[female]] owners, but landlord can apply to both genders. \n\n== History of landlording ==\n''See also  [[Tenement (law)|Tenement]].''\n\nLandlording may be traced back to the Roman Empire and the manorial system ([[seignorialism]]), which began under it \u2014 peasants were bound to the land and dependent on their landlords for protection and justice. Under the [[feudalism]] such relations became widespread.\n\n== Landlord and tenant ==\n\nThe two parties step into relationship under the law of real estate property by signing a contract called lease. With this contract the one party, which has superior title to the property, ie the landlord, grants possession and use of it for a limited period to the other party, ie the tenant. The landlord may not be the actual owner of the property but keeping in some way the right to sub-lease.\n\nA [[rental agreement]], or ''lease'', is the [[contract]] defining such terms as the price paid, penalties for late payments, the length of the rental or lease, and the amount of notice required before either the landlord or tenant cancels the agreement.  In general, responsibilities are given as follow: the landlord is responsible for making repairments and property maintenance, and the tenant is responsible for keeping the property clean and safe.\n\nMany landlords hire a [[property management]] company to take care of all the details of renting their property out to a tenant. This usually includes advertising the property and showing it to prospective tenants, and then, once rented, collecting rent from the tenant and performing repairs as needed.\n\n[[Image:E9438-David-Berry-monument.jpg|thumb|Being a good landlord, David Berry (who had owned much of what is now known as [[Berry, New South Wales|Berry - the town was named after him]]) is well remembered by his tenants.]]\n\nIn the [[United States]], landlord-tenant disputes are primarily governed by [[state law]] (not [[federal law]]) regarding [[property]] and [[contracts]].  State law and, in some places, city law or county law, sets the requirements for [[eviction]] of a tenant.  Generally, there are a limited number of reasons for which a landlord can evict his or her tenant before the expiration of the tenancy, though at the end of the lease term the rental relationship can generally be terminated without giving any reason. Some cities have laws establishing the maximum rent a landlord can charge, known as [[rent control]], and related [[just cause eviction controls]]. There is also an [[Implied_warranty_of_habitability#Habitability|implied warranty of habitability]], whereby a landlord must maintain safe, decent and habitable housing, meeting minimum safety requirements such as smoke detectors and a locking door.\n\nSometimes the terms \"[[slumlord]]\" or \"ghetto landlord\" are used in reference to the owner of dilapidated buildings in blighted urban areas. As a result of declining demand and declining [[real estate prices]], these landlords were often left with completely unprofitable properties and found themselves unable to pay for renovation and the regular maintenance of their property. The situation in many American slums became so dire that some landlords were convicted of [[arson]] after they arranged to have their own buildings set on fire in an attempt to collect on the insurance policies.\n\n==Licensed victualler==\n{{Main|Public house}}\n\nIn the [[United Kingdom]] the owner and\/or manager of a [[public house]] (pub) is also called the \"landlord\", \"licensee\" and often, strictly incorrectly, \"[[publican]]\", the latter properly the appellation of a Roman public contractor or [[Tax farming|tax farmer]].

When a [[juristic person]] is in this position, the term landlord is used. Other terms include '''lessor''' and '''owner'''. The term '''landlady''' may be used for [[female]] owners, and lessor applies to both genders.\n== History of Landowner ==\n''See also  [[Tenement (law)|Tenement]].''\n\nLandowner may be traced back to the Roman Empire and the manorial system ([[seignorialism]]), which began under it \u2014 peasants were bound to the land and dependent on their landlords for protection and justice. Under the [[feudalism]] such relations became widespread.",

Anping, Hebei.jpg|thumb|280px|Powerful landlord in chariot. [[Eastern Han]] 25-220 CE. [[Hebei]], China.]]\nA '''landlord''' is the owner of a [[house]], [[apartment]], [[condominium]], [[land]] or [[real estate]] which is [[Renting|rent]]ed or [[lease]]d to an individual or business, who is called a [[Leasehold estate|tenant]] (also a ''lessee'' or ''renter'').  When a [[juristic person]] is in this position, the term landlord is used. Other terms include '''lessor''' and '''owner'''. The term '''landlady''' may be used for [[female]] owners, and lessor applies to both genders.\n\n== History of landowner ==\nLandowner may be traced back to the Roman Empire and the manorial system ([[seignorialism]]), which began under it \u2014 peasants were bound to the land and dependent on their landlords for protection and justice. Under the [[feudalism]] such relations became widespread.\n\n== Owner and tenant ==\nThe two parties step into relationship under the law of real estate property by signing a contract called lease. With this contract the one party, which has superior title to the property, i.e. the landlord, grants possession and use of it for a limited period to the other party, i.e. the tenant. The landlord\/landlady may not be the actual owner of the property but keeping in some way the right to sub-lease.\n\nA [[rental agreement]], or ''lease'', is the [[contract]] defining such terms as the price paid, penalties for late payments, the length of the rental or lease, and the amount of notice required before either the homeowner or tenant cancels the agreement.  In general, responsibilities are given as follow: the homeowner is responsible for making repairments and property maintenance, and the tenant is responsible for keeping the property clean and safe.\n\nMany owners hire a [[property management]] company to take care of all the details of renting their property out to a tenant. This usually includes advertising the property and showing it to prospective tenants, and then, once rented, collecting rent from the tenant and performing repairs as needed.\n\n[[Image:E9438-David-Berry-monument.jpg|thumb|Being a good landlord, David Berry (who had owned much of what is now known as [[Berry, New South Wales|Berry - the town was named after him]]) is well remembered by his tenants.]]\n\nIn the [[United States]], homeowner-tenant disputes are primarily governed by [[state law]] (not [[federal law]]) regarding [[property]] and [[contracts]].  State law and, in some places, city law or county law, sets the requirements for [[eviction]] of a tenant.  Generally, there are a limited number of reasons for which a landlord or landlady can evict his or her tenant before the expiration of the tenancy, though at the end of the lease term the rental relationship can generally be terminated without giving any reason. Some cities have laws establishing the maximum rent a landlord can charge, known as [[rent control]], and related [[just cause eviction controls]]. There is also an [[Implied_warranty_of_habitability#Habitability|implied warranty of habitability]], whereby a landlord must maintain safe, decent and habitable housing, meeting minimum safety requirements such as smoke detectors and a locking door.\n\n==Licensed victualler==\n{{Main|Public house}}\n\nIn the [[United Kingdom]] the owner and\/or manager of a [[public house]] (pub) is also called the \"landlord\/landlady\", \"licensee\" and often, strictly incorrectly, \"[[publican]]\", the latter properly the appellation of a Roman public contractor or [[Tax farming|tax farmer]].

Eastern Han 25-220 CE. Anping, Hebei.jpg|thumb|280px|Powerful landlord in chariot. [[Eastern Han]] 25-220 CE. [[Hebei]], China.]]\nA '''landlord''' is the male owner of a [[house]], [[apartment]], [[condominium]], land or [[real estate]] which is [[Renting|rent]]ed or [[lease]]d to an individual or business, who is called a [[Leasehold estate|tenant]] (also a ''lessee'' or ''renter'').  When a [[juristic person]] is in this position, the term landlord is used. Other terms include '''lessor''' and '''owner'''. The term '''landlady''' may be used for [[female]] owners, and lessor applies to both genders.\n\n== History of landlord ==\n\"Landlord\" may be traced back to the Roman Empire and the manorial system ([[seignorialism]]), which began under it \u2014 peasants were bound to the land and dependent on their landlords for protection and justice. Under the [[feudalism]] such relations became widespread.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}\n\n== Owner and tenant ==\nThe two parties step into a relationship under the law of real estate property by signing a contract called a lease. With this contract the one party, which has superior title to the property, i.e. the landlord, grants possession and use of it for a limited period to the other party, i.e. the tenant. The landlord\/landlady could be someone other than the actual owner of the property who has the right to sub-lease.\n\nA [[rental agreement]], or ''lease'', is the [[contract]] defining such terms as the price paid, penalties for late payments, the length of the rental or lease, and the amount of notice required before either the homeowner or tenant cancels the agreement.  In general, responsibilities are given as follows: the homeowner is responsible for making repairs and performing property maintenance, and the tenant is responsible for keeping the property clean and safe.\n\nMany owners hire a [[property management]] company to take care of all the details of renting their property out to a tenant. This usually includes advertising the property and showing it to prospective tenants, and then, once rented, collecting rent from the tenant and performing repairs as needed.\n\n[[Image:E9438-David-Berry-monument.jpg|thumb|Being a good landlord, David Berry (who had owned much of what is now known as [[Berry, New South Wales|Berry - the town was named after him]]) is well remembered by his tenants.]]\n\nIn the [[United States]], homeowner-tenant disputes are primarily governed by [[state law]] (not [[federal law]]) regarding [[property]] and [[contracts]].  State law and, in some places, city law or county law, sets the requirements for [[eviction]] of a tenant.  Generally, there are a limited number of reasons for which a landlord or landlady can evict his or her tenant before the expiration of the tenancy, though at the end of the lease term the rental relationship can generally be terminated without giving any reason. Some cities have laws establishing the maximum rent a landlord can charge, known as [[rent control]], and related [[eviction]]. There is also an [[Implied_warranty_of_habitability#Habitability|implied warranty of habitability]], whereby a landlord must maintain safe, decent and habitable housing, meeting minimum safety requirements such as smoke detectors and a locking door.\n\n==Rental investment==\nNet income received, or losses suffered, by an investor from [[renting]] of one or two properties is subject to [[Idiosyncrasy#Idiosyncrasy in economics|idiosyncratic risk]] due to the numerous things that can happen to real property and variable behavior of tenants.<ref name=NYT032913>{{cite news|title=Rental Investment May Seem Safer Than It Really Is|url=http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2013\/03\/30\/your-money\/investing-in-a-rental-home-isnt-as-safe-as-it-may-seem.html|accessdate=March 30, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 29, 2013|author=Tara Siegel Barnard}}<\/ref>\n\n==Licensed victualler==\n{{Main|Pub}}\n\nIn the [[United Kingdom]], the owner and\/or manager of a pub, or public house, is usually called the \"landlord\/landlady\", and often, strictly incorrectly, \"[[publican]]\", the latter properly the appellation of a Roman public contractor or [[Tax farming|tax farmer]].

Eastern Han 25-220 CE. Anping, Hebei.jpg|thumb|280px|Powerful landlord in chariot. [[Eastern Han]] 25-220 CE. [[Hebei]], China.]]\nA '''landlord''' is the owner of a [[house]], [[apartment]], [[condominium]], land or [[real estate]] which is [[Renting|rent]]ed or [[lease]]d to an individual or business, who is called a [[Leasehold estate|tenant]] (also a ''lessee'' or ''renter'').  When a [[juristic person]] is in this position, the term landlord is used. Other terms include '''lessor''' and '''owner'''. The term '''landlady''' may be used for [[female]] owners, and lessor applies to both genders.\n\n== History of landlord ==\n\"Landlord\" may be traced back to the Roman Empire and the manorial system ([[seignorialism]]), which began under it \u2014 peasants were bound to the land and dependent on their landlords for protection and justice.

In general, responsibilities are given as follows: the homeowner is responsible for making repairs and performing property maintenance, and the tenant is responsible for keeping the property clean and safe.\n\nMany owners hire a [[property management]] company to take care of all the details of renting their property out to a tenant. This usually includes advertising the property and showing it to prospective tenants, and then, once rented, collecting rent from the tenant and performing repairs as needed.\n\n[[Image:E9438-David-Berry-monument.jpg|thumb|Being a good landlord, David Berry (who had owned much of what is now known as [[Berry, New South Wales|Berry - the town was named after him]]) is well remembered by his tenants.]]\n\nIn the [[United States]], homeowner-tenant disputes are primarily governed by [[state law]] (not [[federal law]]) regarding [[property]] and [[contracts]].  State law and, in some places, city law or county law, sets the requirements for [[eviction]] of a tenant.  Generally, there are a limited number of reasons for which a landlord or landlady can evict his or her tenant before the expiration of the tenancy, though at the end of the lease term the rental relationship can generally be terminated without giving any reason. Some cities have laws establishing the maximum rent a landlord can charge, known as [[rent control]], and related [[eviction]].

Anping, Hebei.jpg|thumb|280px|Powerful landlord in chariot. [[Eastern Han]] 25-220 CE. [[Hebei]], China.]]\nA '''landlord''' is the owner of a [[house]], [[apartment]], [[condominium]], land or [[real estate]] which is [[Renting|rent]]ed or [[lease]]d to an individual or business, who is called a [[Leasehold estate|tenant]] (also a ''lessee'' or ''renter'').  When a [[juristic person]] is in this position, the term landlord is used. Other terms include '''lessor''' and '''owner'''. The term '''landlady''' may be used for [[female]] owners, and lessor applies to both genders.\n\n== History  ==\nThe concept of a \"landlord\" may be traced back to the Roman Empire and to the manorial system ([[seignorialism]]), which began under it \u2014 peasants became bound to the land and dependent on their landlords for protection and justice. Under [[feudalism]] such relations became widespread.<ref>[http:\/\/faculty.history.wisc.edu\/sommerville\/123\/feudalism.htm Faculty.history.wisc.edu]<\/ref>\n\n== Owner and tenant ==\nA [[rental agreement]], or ''lease'', is the [[contract]] defining such terms as the price paid, penalties for late payments, the length of the rental or lease, and the amount of notice required before either the homeowner or tenant cancels the agreement.  In general, responsibilities are given as follows: the homeowner is responsible for making repairs and performing property maintenance, and the tenant is responsible for keeping the property clean and safe.\n\nMany owners hire a [[property management]] company to take care of all the details of renting their property out to a tenant. This usually includes advertising the property and showing it to prospective tenants, and then, once rented, collecting rent from the tenant and performing repairs as needed.\n\n[[Image:E9438-David-Berry-monument.jpg|thumb|Being a good landlord, [[David Berry (landowner)|David Berry]] (who had owned much of what is now known as [[Berry, New South Wales|Berry - the town was named after him]]) is well remembered by his tenants.]]\n\nIn the [[United States]], homeowner\u2013tenant disputes are primarily governed by [[state law]] (not [[federal law]]) regarding [[property]] and [[contracts]].  State law and, in some places, city law or county law, sets the requirements for [[eviction]] of a tenant.  Generally, there are a limited number of reasons for which a landlord or landlady can evict his or her tenant before the expiration of the tenancy, though at the end of the lease term the rental relationship can generally be terminated without giving any reason. Some cities have laws establishing the maximum rent a landlord can charge, known as [[rent control]], and related [[eviction]]. There is also an [[Implied warranty of habitability#Habitability|implied warranty of habitability]], whereby a landlord must maintain safe, decent and habitable housing, meeting minimum safety requirements such as smoke detectors and a locking door.\n\n==Rental investment==\nNet income received, or losses suffered, by an investor from [[renting]] of one or two properties is subject to [[Idiosyncrasy#Idiosyncrasy in economics|idiosyncratic risk]] due to the numerous things that can happen to real property and variable behavior of tenants.<ref name=NYT032913>{{cite news|title=Rental Investment May Seem Safer Than It Really Is|url=http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2013\/03\/30\/your-money\/investing-in-a-rental-home-isnt-as-safe-as-it-may-seem.html|accessdate=March 30, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 29, 2013|author=Tara Siegel Barnard}}<\/ref>\n\nRental properties can either be paid for monthly or annually depending on the agreement between the landlord and the tenant and is always included in the lease agreement and this is one of the factors that a tenant considers before moving in.<ref name=RentalChoice>{{cite news|title=Rental Properties|url=http:\/\/www.rentalchoice.com\/advantages-of-rental-properties\/|accessdate=Sep 27, 2013}}<\/ref>\n\n==Licensed victualler==\n{{Main|Pub}}\n\nIn the [[United Kingdom]], the owner and\/or manager of a pub, or public house, is usually called the \"landlord\/landlady\", and often, strictly incorrectly, \"[[publican]]\", the latter properly the appellation of a Roman public contractor or [[Tax farming|tax farmer]]. In a more formal situations, the term used is '''licensed victualler''' or simply \"licensee\".<ref name='Dictionary.com'>{{cite web|url=http:\/\/dictionary.reference.com\/browse\/victualler |title= Dictionary.com |accessdate=2008-07-19 }}<\/ref> A female landlord can either be called a ''landlady'' or simply landlord.\n\nThe [[Licensed Trade Charity]], formed in 2004 from the merger of the Society of Licensed Victuallers and Licensed Victualler's National Homes,<ref>{{EW charity|230011|Society of Licensed Victuallers}}<\/ref> exists to serve the retirement needs of Britain's pub landlords.

Anping, Hebei.jpg|thumb|280px|Powerful landlord in chariot. [[Eastern Han]] 25-220 CE. [[Hebei]], China.]]\nA '''landlord''' is the owner of a [[house]], [[apartment]], [[condominium]], land or [[real estate]] which is [[Renting|rent]]ed or [[lease]]d to an individual or business, who is called a [[Leasehold estate|tenant]] (also a ''lessee'' or ''renter'').  When a [[juristic person]] is in this position, the term landlord is used. Other terms include '''lessor''' and '''owner'''. The term '''landlady''' may be used for [[female]] owners, and lessor applies to both genders.\n\n== History  ==\nThe concept of a landlord may be traced back to the [[feudalism|feudal]] system of [[manoralism]] ([[seignorialism]]), where a [[landed estate]] is owned by a [[Lord of the Manor]] ([[mesne lord]]s), usually members of the lower nobility which came to form the rank of [[knight]]s in the high medieval period, holding their fief via [[subinfeudation]], but in some cases the land may also be directly subject to a member of higher nobility, as in the [[royal domain]] directly owned by a king, or in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] [[Imperial Village|imperial villages]] directly subject to the emperor.\nThe medieval system ultimately continues the system of [[Roman villa|villas]] and [[latifundium|latifundia]] of the [[Roman Empire]].<ref>[http:\/\/faculty.history.wisc.edu\/sommerville\/123\/feudalism.htm Faculty.history.wisc.edu]<\/ref>\n\n== Owner and tenant ==\nA [[rental agreement]], or ''lease'', is the [[contract]] defining such terms as the price paid, penalties for late payments, the length of the rental or lease, and the amount of notice required before either the homeowner or tenant cancels the agreement.  In general, responsibilities are given as follows: the homeowner is responsible for making repairs and performing property maintenance, and the tenant is responsible for keeping the property clean and safe.\n\nMany owners hire a [[property management]] company to take care of all the details of renting their property out to a tenant. This usually includes advertising the property and showing it to prospective tenants, and then, once rented, collecting rent from the tenant and performing repairs as needed.\n\n[[Image:E9438-David-Berry-monument.jpg|thumb|Being a good landlord, [[David Berry (landowner)|David Berry]] (who had owned much of what is now known as [[Berry, New South Wales|Berry - the town was named after him]]) is well remembered by his tenants.]]\n\nIn the [[United States]], homeowner\u2013tenant disputes are primarily governed by [[state law]] (not [[federal law]]) regarding [[property]] and [[contracts]].  State law and, in some places, city law or county law, sets the requirements for [[eviction]] of a tenant.  Generally, there are a limited number of reasons for which a landlord or landlady can evict his or her tenant before the expiration of the tenancy, though at the end of the lease term the rental relationship can generally be terminated without giving any reason. Some cities have laws establishing the maximum rent a landlord can charge, known as [[rent control]], and related [[eviction]]. There is also an [[Implied warranty of habitability#Habitability|implied warranty of habitability]], whereby a landlord must maintain safe, decent and habitable housing, meeting minimum safety requirements such as smoke detectors and a locking door. These laws are quite necessary, as many landlords will attempt to defraud and exploit their tenants as far as the law will allow them to.\n\n==Rental investment==\nNet income received, or losses suffered, by an investor from [[renting]] of one or two properties is subject to [[Idiosyncrasy#Idiosyncrasy in economics|idiosyncratic risk]] due to the numerous things that can happen to real property and variable behavior of tenants.<ref name=NYT032913>{{cite news|title=Rental Investment May Seem Safer Than It Really Is|url=http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2013\/03\/30\/your-money\/investing-in-a-rental-home-isnt-as-safe-as-it-may-seem.html|accessdate=March 30, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 29, 2013|author=Tara Siegel Barnard}}<\/ref>\n\nRental properties can either be paid for monthly or annually depending on the agreement between the landlord and the tenant and is always included in the lease agreement and this is one of the factors that a tenant considers before moving in.<ref name=RentalChoice>{{cite news|title=Rental Properties|url=http:\/\/www.rentalchoice.com\/advantages-of-rental-properties\/|accessdate=Sep 27, 2013}}<\/ref>\n\n==Licensed victualler==\n{{Main|Pub}}\n\nIn the [[United Kingdom]], the owner and\/or manager of a pub, or public house, is usually called the \"landlord\/landlady\", and often, strictly incorrectly, \"[[publican]]\", the latter properly the appellation of a Roman public contractor or [[Tax farming|tax farmer]].

The term '''landlady''' may be used for [[female]] owners, and lessor applies to both genders.\n\n== History  ==\nThe concept of a landlord may be traced back to the [[feudalism|feudal]] system of [[manoralism]] ([[seignorialism]]), where a [[landed estate]] is owned by a [[Lord of the Manor]] ([[mesne lord]]s), usually members of the lower nobility which came to form the rank of [[knight]]s in the high medieval period, holding their fief via [[subinfeudation]], but in some cases the land may also be directly subject to a member of higher nobility, as in the [[royal domain]] directly owned by a king, or in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] [[Imperial Village|imperial villages]] directly subject to the emperor.\nThe medieval system ultimately continues the system of [[Roman villa|villas]] and [[latifundium|latifundia]] of the [[Roman Empire]].<ref>[http:\/\/faculty.history.wisc.edu\/sommerville\/123\/feudalism.htm Faculty.history.wisc.edu]<\/ref> Some \"tenants\" find the term \"landlord\" offensive, since the person they rent their residence from is not thereby their feudal lord.\n\n== Owner and tenant ==\nA [[rental agreement]], or ''lease'', is the [[contract]] defining such terms as the price paid, penalties for late payments, the length of the rental or lease, and the amount of notice required before either the homeowner or tenant cancels the agreement.

The term '''landlady''' may be used for [[female]] owners, and lessor applies to both genders.

Anping, Hebei.jpg|thumb|280px|Powerful landlord in chariot. [[Eastern Han]] 25-220 CE. [[Hebei]], China.]]\nA '''landlord''' is the owner of a [[house]], [[apartment]], [[condominium]], land or [[real estate]] which is [[Renting|rent]]ed or [[lease]]d to an individual or business, who is called a [[Leasehold estate|tenant]] (also a ''lessee'' or ''renter'').  When a [[juristic person]] is in this position, the term landlord is used. Other terms include '''lessor''' and '''owner'''. The term '''landlady''' may be used for [[female]] owners, and lessor applies to both genders. Many municipalities and state governments have now legislated significant codes of tenants' rights to protect tenants against unethical business practices. <ref>http:\/\/www.oag.state.ny.us\/sites\/default\/files\/pdfs\/publications\/Tenant_Rights_2011.pdf<\/ref>, <ref>http:\/\/www.dca.ca.gov\/publications\/landlordbook\/catenant.pdf<\/ref>\n\n== History  ==\nThe concept of a landlord may be traced back to the [[feudalism|feudal]] system of [[manoralism]] ([[seignorialism]]), where a [[landed estate]] is owned by a [[Lord of the Manor]] ([[mesne lord]]s), usually members of the lower nobility which came to form the rank of [[knight]]s in the high medieval period, holding their fief via [[subinfeudation]], but in some cases the land may also be directly subject to a member of higher nobility, as in the [[royal domain]] directly owned by a king, or in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] [[Imperial Village|imperial villages]] directly subject to the emperor.\nThe medieval system ultimately continues the system of [[Roman villa|villas]] and [[latifundium|latifundia]] of the [[Roman Empire]].<ref>[http:\/\/faculty.history.wisc.edu\/sommerville\/123\/feudalism.htm Faculty.history.wisc.edu]<\/ref> \n\nSome contemporary tenants find the term 'landlord' offensive, since this is no longer feudal Europe, and the \"landlord\" is in no way a \"lord\" over his tenant. They are simply two persons who have made a contractual agreement for a certain class of goods and services. <ref>http:\/\/www.city-data.com\/forum\/new-york-city\/387409-buyout-rent-stabilized-nyc-apartment-10.html<\/ref>\n\n== Owner and tenant ==\nA [[rental agreement]], or ''lease'', is the [[contract]] defining such terms as the price paid, penalties for late payments, the length of the rental or lease, and the amount of notice required before either the homeowner or tenant cancels the agreement.  In general, responsibilities are given as follows: the homeowner is responsible for making repairs and performing property maintenance, and the tenant is responsible for keeping the property clean and safe.\n\nMany owners hire a [[property management]] company to take care of all the details of renting their property out to a tenant. This usually includes advertising the property and showing it to prospective tenants, negotiating and preparing the written leases, and then, once rented, collecting rent from the tenant and performing repairs as needed.\n\n[[Image:E9438-David-Berry-monument.jpg|thumb|Being a good landlord, [[David Berry (landowner)|David Berry]] (who had owned much of what is now known as [[Berry, New South Wales|Berry - the town was named after him]]) is well remembered by his tenants.]]\n\nIn the [[United States]], homeowner\u2013tenant disputes are primarily governed by [[state law]] (not [[federal law]]) regarding [[property]] and [[contracts]].  State law and, in some places, city law or county law, sets the requirements for [[eviction]] of a tenant.  Generally, there are a limited number of reasons for which a landlord or landlady can evict his or her tenant before the expiration of the tenancy, though at the end of the lease term the rental relationship can generally be terminated without giving any reason. Some cities, counties, and States have laws establishing the maximum rent a landlord can charge, known as [[rent control]], and related [[eviction]]. There is also an [[Implied warranty of habitability#Habitability|implied warranty of habitability]], whereby a landlord must maintain safe, decent and habitable housing, meeting minimum safety requirements such as smoke detectors and a locking door.\n\n==Rental investment==\nNet income received, or losses suffered, by an investor from [[renting]] of one or two properties is subject to [[Idiosyncrasy#Idiosyncrasy in economics|idiosyncratic risk]] due to the numerous things that can happen to real property and variable behavior of tenants.<ref name=NYT032913>{{cite news|title=Rental Investment May Seem Safer Than It Really Is|url=http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2013\/03\/30\/your-money\/investing-in-a-rental-home-isnt-as-safe-as-it-may-seem.html|accessdate=March 30, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 29, 2013|author=Tara Siegel Barnard}}<\/ref>\n\nRental properties can either be paid for monthly or annually depending on the agreement between the landlord and the tenant and is always included in the lease agreement and this is one of the factors that a tenant considers before moving in.<ref name=RentalChoice>{{cite news|title=Rental Properties|url=http:\/\/www.rentalchoice.com\/advantages-of-rental-properties\/|accessdate=Sep 27, 2013}}<\/ref>\n\n==Licensed victualler==\n{{Main|Pub}}\n\nIn the [[United Kingdom]], the owner and\/or manager of a pub, or public house, is usually called the \"landlord\/landlady\", and often, strictly incorrectly, \"[[publican]]\", the latter properly the appellation of a Roman public contractor or [[Tax farming|tax farmer]].

Anping, Hebei.jpg|thumb|280px|Powerful landlord in chariot. [[Eastern Han]] 25-220 CE. [[Hebei]], China.]]\nA '''landlord''' is the owner of a [[house]], [[apartment]], [[condominium]], land or [[real estate]] which is [[Renting|rent]]ed or [[lease]]d to an individual or business, who is called a [[Leasehold estate|tenant]] (also a ''lessee'' or ''renter'').  When a [[juristic person]] is in this position, the term landlord is used. Other terms include '''lessor''' and '''owner'''. The term '''landlady''' may be used for [[female]] owners, and lessor applies to both genders. Many municipalities and state governments have now legislated significant codes of tenants' rights to protect tenants against unethical business practices. <ref>http:\/\/www.oag.state.ny.us\/sites\/default\/files\/pdfs\/publications\/Tenant_Rights_2011.pdf<\/ref>, <ref>http:\/\/www.dca.ca.gov\/publications\/landlordbook\/catenant.pdf<\/ref>\n\n== History ==\nThe concept of a landlord may be traced back to the [[feudalism|feudal]] system of [[manoralism]] ([[seignorialism]]), where a [[landed estate]] is owned by a [[Lord of the Manor]] ([[mesne lord]]s), usually members of the lower nobility which came to form the rank of [[knight]]s in the high medieval period, holding their fief via [[subinfeudation]], but in some cases the land may also be directly subject to a member of higher nobility, as in the [[royal domain]] directly owned by a king, or in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] [[Imperial Village|imperial villages]] directly subject to the emperor.\nThe medieval system ultimately continues the system of [[Roman villa|villas]] and [[latifundium|latifundia]] of the [[Roman Empire]].<ref>[http:\/\/faculty.history.wisc.edu\/sommerville\/123\/feudalism.htm Faculty.history.wisc.edu]<\/ref>\n\n== Owner and tenant ==\nA [[rental agreement]], or ''lease'', is the [[contract]] defining such terms as the price paid, penalties for late payments, the length of the rental or lease, and the amount of notice required before either the homeowner or tenant cancels the agreement.  In general, responsibilities are given as follows: the homeowner is responsible for making repairs and performing property maintenance, and the tenant is responsible for keeping the property clean and safe.\n\nMany owners hire a [[property management]] company to take care of all the details of renting their property out to a tenant. This usually includes advertising the property and showing it to prospective tenants, negotiating and preparing the written leases, and then, once rented, collecting rent from the tenant and performing repairs as needed.\n\n[[Image:E9438-David-Berry-monument.jpg|thumb|Being a good landlord, [[David Berry (landowner)|David Berry]] (who had owned much of what is now known as [[Berry, New South Wales|Berry - the town was named after him]]) is well remembered by his tenants.]]\n\nIn the [[United States]], homeowner\u2013tenant disputes are primarily governed by [[state law]] (not [[federal law]]) regarding [[property]] and [[contracts]].  State law and, in some places, city law or county law, sets the requirements for [[eviction]] of a tenant.  Generally, there are a limited number of reasons for which a landlord or landlady can evict his or her tenant before the expiration of the tenancy, though at the end of the lease term the rental relationship can generally be terminated without giving any reason. Some cities, counties, and States have laws establishing the maximum rent a landlord can charge, known as [[rent control]], and related [[eviction]]. There is also an [[Implied warranty of habitability#Habitability|implied warranty of habitability]], whereby a landlord must maintain safe, decent and habitable housing, meeting minimum safety requirements such as smoke detectors and a locking door.\n\n==Rental investment==\nNet income received, or losses suffered, by an investor from [[renting]] of one or two properties is subject to [[Idiosyncrasy#Idiosyncrasy in economics|idiosyncratic risk]] due to the numerous things that can happen to real property and variable behavior of tenants.<ref name=NYT032913>{{cite news|title=Rental Investment May Seem Safer Than It Really Is|url=http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2013\/03\/30\/your-money\/investing-in-a-rental-home-isnt-as-safe-as-it-may-seem.html|accessdate=March 30, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 29, 2013|author=Tara Siegel Barnard}}<\/ref>\n\nRental properties can either be paid for monthly or annually depending on the agreement between the landlord and the tenant and is always included in the lease agreement and this is one of the factors that a tenant considers before moving in.<ref name=RentalChoice>{{cite news|title=Rental Properties|url=http:\/\/www.rentalchoice.com\/advantages-of-rental-properties\/|accessdate=Sep 27, 2013}}<\/ref>\n\n==Licensed victualler==\n{{Main|Pub}}\n\nIn the [[United Kingdom]], the owner and\/or manager of a pub, or public house, is usually called the \"landlord\/landlady\", and often, strictly incorrectly, \"[[publican]]\", the latter properly the appellation of a Roman public contractor or [[Tax farming|tax farmer]]. In a more formal situations, the term used is '''licensed victualler''' or simply \"licensee\".<ref name='Dictionary.com'>{{cite web|url=http:\/\/dictionary.reference.com\/browse\/victualler |title= Dictionary.com |accessdate=2008-07-19 }}<\/ref> A female landlord can either be called a ''landlady'' or simply landlord.\n\nThe [[Licensed Trade Charity]], formed in 2004 from the merger of the Society of Licensed Victuallers and Licensed Victualler's National Homes,<ref>{{EW charity|230011|Society of Licensed Victuallers}}<\/ref> exists to serve the retirement needs of Britain's pub landlords. The charity also runs three private schools in [[Ascot, Berkshire|Ascot]] and [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]] in [[Berkshire]] and [[Sayers Common]] in [[Sussex]]. As well as having normal full fee paying students, [[Licensed Victuallers' School]] in Ascot provides discounted education prices for the children of landlords and others in the catering industry.\n\n==Landlord policing responsibilities==\n\nIn some American cities, city government working with neighborhood activists has blamed landlords for crime, especially in the inner city. Punishment comes in the form of revoked rental licenses when city inspectors have identified a certain number of criminal incidents associated with buildings.  Some landlords, especially in [[Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul]], have successfully organized against this type of politics.<ref>[http:\/\/www.landlordpolitics.com Landorpolitics.com]<\/ref>\n\n==References==\n{{wiktionary|landlord}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Real estate}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n[[Category:Real estate]]\n[[Category:Real property law]]",

When a [[juristic person]] is in this position, the term landlord is used. Other terms include '''lessor''' and '''owner'''. The term '''landlady''' may be used for [[female]] owners, and lessor applies to both genders.

For example, Karl Marx, the famed theorist of Communism, described landlords as part of the \"petit bourgeoisie\" and that \"the landlord exploits everything from which society benefits.\" in the Economic Manuscripts of 1844. On the other side of the Political Philosophical spectrum, Adam Smith, perhaps the greatest theorist of Capitalist to ever write, largely concurred with Marx's negative opinion of landlords, writing that  \"Landlords\u2019 right has its origin in robbery.\" (Say, t. 1, p. 136, footnote.)  Smith also stated that: \"The landlords, like all other men, love to reap where they never sowed, and demand a rent even for the natural produce of the earth. (Adam Smith, op. cit., Vol. I, p. 44.)\" Even more harshly, Smith concluded that \u201cThe rent of land, it may be thought, is frequently no more than a reasonable profit or interest for the stock laid out by the landlord upon its improvement. This, no doubt, may be partly the case upon some occasions.... The landlord demands\u201d (1) \u201ca rent even for unimproved land, and the supposed interest or profit upon the expense of improvement is generally an addition to this original rent.\u201d (2) \u201cThose improvements, besides, are not always made by the stock of the landlord, but sometimes by that of the tenant. When the lease comes to be renewed, however, the landlord commonly demands the same augmentation of rent as if they had been all made by his own.\u201d (3) \u201cHe sometimes demands rent for what is altogether incapable of human improvement.\u201d (Adam Smith, op. cit., Vol. I, p. 131) Smith's critiques of the benefit to society from landlords thus played a key role in Marx's economic, political, and philosophical theories. <ref> https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/marx\/works\/1844\/manuscripts\/rent.htm<\/ref>\n\n== Owner and tenant ==\nA [[rental agreement]], or ''lease'', is the [[contract]] defining such terms as the price paid, penalties for late payments, the length of the rental or lease, and the amount of notice required before either the homeowner or tenant cancels the agreement.  In general, responsibilities are given as follows: the homeowner is responsible for making repairs and performing property maintenance, and the tenant is responsible for keeping the property clean and safe.\n\nMany owners hire a [[property management]] company to take care of all the details of renting their property out to a tenant.

There is also an [[Implied warranty of habitability#Habitability|implied warranty of habitability]], whereby a landlord must maintain safe, decent and habitable housing, meeting minimum safety requirements such as smoke detectors and a locking door.\n\n==Rental investment==\nNet income received, or losses suffered, by an investor from [[renting]] of one or two properties is subject to [[Idiosyncrasy#Idiosyncrasy in economics|idiosyncratic risk]] due to the numerous things that can happen to real property and variable behavior of tenants.<ref name=NYT032913>{{cite news|title=Rental Investment May Seem Safer Than It Really Is|url=http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2013\/03\/30\/your-money\/investing-in-a-rental-home-isnt-as-safe-as-it-may-seem.html|accessdate=March 30, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 29, 2013|author=Tara Siegel Barnard}}<\/ref>\n\nRental properties can either be paid for monthly or annually depending on the agreement between the landlord and the tenant and is always included in the lease agreement and this is one of the factors that a tenant considers before moving in.<ref name=RentalChoice>{{cite news|title=Rental Properties|url=http:\/\/www.rentalchoice.com\/advantages-of-rental-properties\/|accessdate=Sep 27, 2013}}<\/ref>\n\n==Licensed victualler==\n{{Main|Pub}}\n\nIn the [[United Kingdom]], the owner and\/or manager of a pub, or public house, is usually called the \"landlord\/landlady\", and often, strictly incorrectly, \"[[publican]]\", the latter properly the appellation of a Roman public contractor or [[Tax farming|tax farmer]].

Anping, Hebei.jpg|thumb|280px|Powerful landlord in chariot. [[Eastern Han]] 25-220 CE. [[Hebei]], China.]]\nA '''landlord''' is the owner of a [[house]], [[apartment]], [[condominium]], land or [[real estate]] which is [[Renting|rent]]ed or [[lease]]d to an individual or business, who is called a [[Leasehold estate|tenant]] (also a ''lessee'' or ''renter'').  When a [[juristic person]] is in this position, the term landlord is used. Other terms include '''lessor''' and '''owner'''. The term '''landlady''' may be used for [[female]] owners, and lessor applies to both genders. Many municipalities and state governments have now legislated significant codes of tenants' rights to protect tenants against unethical business practices.<ref>http:\/\/www.oag.state.ny.us\/sites\/default\/files\/pdfs\/publications\/Tenant_Rights_2011.pdf<\/ref><ref>http:\/\/www.dca.ca.gov\/publications\/landlordbook\/catenant.pdf<\/ref>\n\n== History ==\nThe concept of a landlord may be traced back to the [[feudalism|feudal]] system of [[manoralism]] ([[seignorialism]]), where a [[landed estate]] is owned by a [[Lord of the Manor]] ([[mesne lord]]s), usually members of the lower nobility which came to form the rank of [[knight]]s in the high medieval period, holding their fief via [[subinfeudation]], but in some cases the land may also be directly subject to a member of higher nobility, as in the [[royal domain]] directly owned by a king, or in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] [[Imperial Village|imperial villages]] directly subject to the emperor.\nThe medieval system ultimately continues the system of [[Roman villa|villas]] and [[latifundium|latifundia]] of the [[Roman Empire]].<ref>[http:\/\/faculty.history.wisc.edu\/sommerville\/123\/feudalism.htm Faculty.history.wisc.edu]<\/ref>\n\nSeveral extremely influential economic philosophers of quite divergent viewpoints have written a great deal about landlords. For example, Karl Marx, the famed theorist of Communism, described landlords as part of the \"petit bourgeoisie\" and that \"the landlord exploits everything from which society benefits.\" in the Economic Manuscripts of 1844. On the other side of the Political Philosophical spectrum, Adam Smith, perhaps the greatest theorist of Capitalist to ever write, largely concurred with Marx's negative opinion of landlords, writing that  \"Landlords\u2019 right has its origin in robbery.\" (Say, t. 1, p. 136, footnote.)  Smith also stated that: \"The landlords, like all other men, love to reap where they never sowed, and demand a rent even for the natural produce of the earth. (Adam Smith, op. cit., Vol. I, p. 44.)\" Even more harshly, Smith concluded that \u201cThe rent of land, it may be thought, is frequently no more than a reasonable profit or interest for the stock laid out by the landlord upon its improvement. This, no doubt, may be partly the case upon some occasions.... The landlord demands\u201d (1) \u201ca rent even for unimproved land, and the supposed interest or profit upon the expense of improvement is generally an addition to this original rent.\u201d (2) \u201cThose improvements, besides, are not always made by the stock of the landlord, but sometimes by that of the tenant. When the lease comes to be renewed, however, the landlord commonly demands the same augmentation of rent as if they had been all made by his own.\u201d (3) \u201cHe sometimes demands rent for what is altogether incapable of human improvement.\u201d (Adam Smith, op. cit., Vol. I, p. 131) Smith's critiques of the benefit to society from landlords thus played a key role in the formation of Marx's economic, political, and philosophical theories. <ref> https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/marx\/works\/1844\/manuscripts\/rent.htm<\/ref>\n\n== Owner and tenant ==\nA [[rental agreement]], or ''lease'', is the [[contract]] defining such terms as the price paid, penalties for late payments, the length of the rental or lease, and the amount of notice required before either the homeowner or tenant cancels the agreement.  In general, responsibilities are given as follows: the homeowner is responsible for making repairs and performing property maintenance, and the tenant is responsible for keeping the property clean and safe.\n\nMany owners hire a [[property management]] company to take care of all the details of renting their property out to a tenant. This usually includes advertising the property and showing it to prospective tenants, negotiating and preparing the written leases, and then, once rented, collecting rent from the tenant and performing repairs as needed.\n\n[[Image:E9438-David-Berry-monument.jpg|thumb|Being a good landlord, [[David Berry (landowner)|David Berry]] (who had owned much of what is now known as [[Berry, New South Wales|Berry - the town was named after him]]) is well remembered by his tenants.]]\n\nIn the [[United States]], homeowner\u2013tenant disputes are primarily governed by [[state law]] (not [[federal law]]) regarding [[property]] and [[contracts]].  State law and, in some places, city law or county law, sets the requirements for [[eviction]] of a tenant.  Generally, there are a limited number of reasons for which a landlord or landlady can evict his or her tenant before the expiration of the tenancy, though at the end of the lease term the rental relationship can generally be terminated without giving any reason. Some cities, counties, and States have laws establishing the maximum rent a landlord can charge, known as [[rent control]], and related [[eviction]].

Anping, Hebei.jpg|thumb|280px|Powerful landlord in chariot. [[Eastern Han]] 25-220 CE. [[Hebei]], China.]]\nA '''landlord''' is the owner of a [[house]], [[apartment]], [[condominium]], land or [[real estate]] which is [[Renting|rent]]ed or [[lease]]d to an individual or business, who is called a [[Leasehold estate|tenant]] (also a ''lessee'' or ''renter'').  When a [[juristic person]] is in this position, the term landlord is used. Other terms include '''lessor''' and '''owner'''. The term '''landlady''' may be used for [[female]] owners, and lessor applies to both genders.\n\n== History  ==\nThe concept of a landlord may be traced back to the [[feudalism|feudal]] system of [[manoralism]] ([[seignorialism]]), where a [[landed estate]] is owned by a [[Lord of the Manor]] ([[mesne lord]]s), usually members of the lower nobility which came to form the rank of [[knight]]s in the high medieval period, holding their fief via [[subinfeudation]], but in some cases the land may also be directly subject to a member of higher nobility, as in the [[royal domain]] directly owned by a king, or in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] [[Imperial Village|imperial villages]] directly subject to the emperor.\nThe medieval system ultimately continues the system of [[Roman villa|villas]] and [[latifundium|latifundia]] of the [[Roman Empire]].<ref>[http:\/\/faculty.history.wisc.edu\/sommerville\/123\/feudalism.htm Faculty.history.wisc.edu]<\/ref>\n\n== Owner and tenant ==\nA [[rental agreement]], or ''lease'', is the [[contract]] defining such terms as the price paid, penalties for late payments, the length of the rental or lease, and the amount of notice required before either the homeowner or tenant cancels the agreement.  In general, responsibilities are given as follows: the homeowner is responsible for making repairs and performing property maintenance, and the tenant is responsible for keeping the property clean and safe.\n\nMany owners hire a [[property management]] company to take care of all the details of renting their property out to a tenant. This usually includes advertising the property and showing it to prospective tenants, and then, once rented, collecting rent from the tenant and performing repairs as needed.\n\n[[Image:E9438-David-Berry-monument.jpg|thumb|Being a good landlord, [[David Berry (landowner)|David Berry]] (who had owned much of what is now known as [[Berry, New South Wales|Berry - the town was named after him]]) is well remembered by his tenants.]]\n\nIn the [[United States]], homeowner\u2013tenant disputes are primarily governed by [[state law]] (not [[federal law]]) regarding [[property]] and [[contracts]].  State law and, in some places, city law or county law, sets the requirements for [[eviction]] of a tenant.  Generally, there are a limited number of reasons for which a landlord or landlady can evict his or her tenant before the expiration of the tenancy, though at the end of the lease term the rental relationship can generally be terminated without giving any reason. Some cities have laws establishing the maximum rent a landlord can charge, known as [[rent control]], and related [[eviction]]. There is also an [[Implied warranty of habitability#Habitability|implied warranty of habitability]], whereby a landlord must maintain safe, decent and habitable housing, meeting minimum safety requirements such as smoke detectors and a locking door.\n\n==Rental investment==\nNet income received, or losses suffered, by an investor from [[renting]] of one or two properties is subject to [[Idiosyncrasy#Idiosyncrasy in economics|idiosyncratic risk]] due to the numerous things that can happen to real property and variable behavior of tenants.<ref name=NYT032913>{{cite news|title=Rental Investment May Seem Safer Than It Really Is|url=http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2013\/03\/30\/your-money\/investing-in-a-rental-home-isnt-as-safe-as-it-may-seem.html|accessdate=March 30, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 29, 2013|author=Tara Siegel Barnard}}<\/ref>\n\nRental properties can either be paid for monthly or annually depending on the agreement between the landlord and the tenant and is always included in the lease agreement and this is one of the factors that a tenant considers before moving in.<ref name=RentalChoice>{{cite news|title=Rental Properties|url=http:\/\/www.rentalchoice.com\/advantages-of-rental-properties\/|accessdate=Sep 27, 2013}}<\/ref>\n\n==Licensed victualler==\n{{Main|Pub}}\n\nIn the [[United Kingdom]], the owner and\/or manager of a pub, or public house, is usually called the \"landlord\/landlady\", and often, strictly incorrectly, \"[[publican]]\", the latter properly the appellation of a Roman public contractor or [[Tax farming|tax farmer]]. In a more formal situations, the term used is '''licensed victualler''' or simply \"licensee\".<ref name='Dictionary.com'>{{cite web|url=http:\/\/dictionary.reference.com\/browse\/victualler |title= Dictionary.com |accessdate=2008-07-19 }}<\/ref> A female landlord can either be called a ''landlady'' or simply landlord.\n\nThe [[Licensed Trade Charity]], formed in 2004 from the merger of the Society of Licensed Victuallers and Licensed Victualler's National Homes,<ref>{{EW charity|230011|Society of Licensed Victuallers}}<\/ref> exists to serve the retirement needs of Britain's pub landlords. The charity also runs three private schools in [[Ascot, Berkshire|Ascot]] and [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]] in [[Berkshire]] and [[Sayers Common]] in [[Sussex]]. As well as having normal full fee paying students, [[Licensed Victuallers' School]] in Ascot provides discounted education prices for the children of landlords and others in the catering industry.\n\n==Landlord policing responsibilities==\n\nIn some American cities, city government working with neighborhood activists has blamed landlords for crime, especially in the inner city. Punishment comes in the form of revoked rental licenses when city inspectors have identified a certain number of criminal incidents associated with buildings.  Some landlords, especially in [[Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul]], have successfully organized against this type of politics.<ref>[http:\/\/www.landlordpolitics.com Landorpolitics.com]<\/ref>\n\n==References==\n{{wiktionary|landlord}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http:\/\/www.american-apartment-owners-association.org\/property-management\/landlord-quick-tips\/8-tips-new-landlords-rent-owner\/ Tips for New Landlords]\n\n{{Real estate}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n[[Category:Real estate]]\n[[Category:Real property law]]",

On the other side of the Political Philosophical spectrum, Adam Smith, perhaps the greatest theorist of Capitalist to ever write, largely concurred with Marx's negative opinion of landlords, writing that  \"Landlords\u2019 right has its origin in robbery.\" (Say, t. 1, p. 136, footnote.)

When the lease comes to be renewed, however, the landlord commonly demands the same augmentation of rent as if they had been all made by his own.\u201d (3) \u201cHe sometimes demands rent for what is altogether incapable of human improvement.\u201d (Adam Smith, op. cit., Vol. I, p. 131) Smith's critiques of the benefit to society from landlords thus played a key role in Marx's economic, political, and philosophical theories. <ref> https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/marx\/works\/1844\/manuscripts\/rent.htm<\/ref>\n\n== Owner and tenant ==\nA [[rental agreement]], or ''lease'', is the [[contract]] defining such terms as the price paid, penalties for late payments, the length of the rental or lease, and the amount of notice required before either the homeowner or tenant cancels the agreement.

When a [[juristic person]] is in this position, the term landlord is used. Other terms include '''lessor''' and '''owner'''. The term '''landlady''' may be used for [[female]] owners, and lessor applies to both genders.

For example, [[Karl Marx]], the famed theorist of [[Communism]], described landlords as part of the \"[[Petite bourgeoisie]]\" and that \"the landlord exploits everything from which society benefits.\" in the Economic Manuscripts of 1844. On the other side of the [[Political Philosophy|Political Philosophical]] spectrum, [[Adam Smith]], perhaps the greatest theorist of [[Capitalism]] to ever write, largely concurred with Marx's negative opinion of landlords, writing that  \"Landlords\u2019 right has its origin in robbery.\" (Say, t. 1, p. 136, footnote.)  Smith also stated that: \"The landlords, like all other men, love to reap where they never sowed, and demand a rent even for the natural produce of the earth. (Adam Smith, op. cit., Vol. I, p. 44.)\" Even more harshly, Smith concluded that \u201cThe rent of land, it may be thought, is frequently no more than a reasonable profit or interest for the stock laid out by the landlord upon its improvement. This, no doubt, may be partly the case upon some occasions.... The landlord demands\u201d (1) \u201ca rent even for unimproved land, and the supposed interest or profit upon the expense of improvement is generally an addition to this original rent.\u201d (2) \u201cThose improvements, besides, are not always made by the stock of the landlord, but sometimes by that of the tenant. When the lease comes to be renewed, however, the landlord commonly demands the same augmentation of rent as if they had been all made by his own.\u201d (3) \u201cHe sometimes demands rent for what is altogether incapable of human improvement.\u201d (Adam Smith, op. cit., Vol. I, p. 131) Smith's critiques of the benefit to society from landlords thus played a key role in Marx's economic, political, and philosophical theories. <ref> https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/marx\/works\/1844\/manuscripts\/rent.htm<\/ref>\n\n== Owner and tenant ==\nA [[rental agreement]], or ''lease'', is the [[contract]] defining such terms as the price paid, penalties for late payments, the length of the rental or lease, and the amount of notice required before either the homeowner or tenant cancels the agreement.  In general, responsibilities are given as follows: the homeowner is responsible for making repairs and performing property maintenance, and the tenant is responsible for keeping the property clean and safe.\n\nMany owners hire a [[property management]] company to take care of all the details of renting their property out to a tenant.

Anping, Hebei.jpg|thumb|280px|Powerful landlord in chariot. [[Eastern Han]] 25-220 CE. [[Hebei]], China.]]\nA '''landlord''' is the owner of a [[house]], [[apartment]], [[condominium]], land or [[real estate]] which is [[Renting|rent]]ed or [[lease]]d to an individual or business, who is called a [[Leasehold estate|tenant]] (also a ''lessee'' or ''renter'').  When a [[juristic person]] is in this position, the term landlord is used. Other terms include '''lessor''' and '''owner'''. The term '''landlady''' may be used for [[female]] owners, and lessor applies to both genders. 'Tenants' often find the term 'landlord' offensive, due to its historical connection with regimes of feudal serfdom, that were tantamount to slavery. Contemporary landlords are not 'lords' in any meaningful sense. Many municipalities and state governments have now legislated significant codes of tenants' rights to protect tenants against unethical business practices.<ref>http:\/\/www.oag.state.ny.us\/sites\/default\/files\/pdfs\/publications\/Tenant_Rights_2011.pdf<\/ref><ref>http:\/\/www.dca.ca.gov\/publications\/landlordbook\/catenant.pdf<\/ref>\n\n== History ==\nThe concept of a landlord may be traced back to the [[feudalism|feudal]] system of [[manoralism]] ([[seignorialism]]), where a [[landed estate]] is owned by a [[Lord of the Manor]] ([[mesne lord]]s), usually members of the lower nobility which came to form the rank of [[knight]]s in the high medieval period, holding their fief via [[subinfeudation]], but in some cases the land may also be directly subject to a member of higher nobility, as in the [[royal domain]] directly owned by a king, or in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] [[Imperial Village|imperial villages]] directly subject to the emperor.\nThe medieval system ultimately continues the system of [[Roman villa|villas]] and [[latifundium|latifundia]] of the [[Roman Empire]].<ref>[http:\/\/faculty.history.wisc.edu\/sommerville\/123\/feudalism.htm Faculty.history.wisc.edu]<\/ref>\n\nSeveral extremely influential [[economic philosophy| economic philosophers]] of apparently quite divergent viewpoints have written a great deal about landlords. For example, [[Karl Marx]], the famed theorist of [[Communism]], described landlords as part of the \"[[Petite bourgeoisie]]\" and that \"the landlord exploits everything from which society benefits.\" in the ''[[Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844]]''. On the other side of the [[Political Philosophy|Political Philosophical]] spectrum, [[Adam Smith]], perhaps the greatest theorist of [[Capitalism]] to ever write, largely concurred with Marx's negative opinion of landlords, writing that  \"Landlords\u2019 right has its origin in robbery.\" (Say, t. 1, p. 136, footnote.)  Smith also stated that: \"The landlords, like all other men, love to reap where they never sowed, and demand a rent even for the natural produce of the earth. (Adam Smith, op. cit., Vol. I, p. 44.)\" Even more harshly, Smith concluded that \u201cThe rent of land, it may be thought, is frequently no more than a reasonable profit or interest for the stock laid out by the landlord upon its improvement. This, no doubt, may be partly the case upon some occasions.... The landlord demands\u201d (1) \u201ca rent even for unimproved land, and the supposed interest or profit upon the expense of improvement is generally an addition to this original rent.\u201d (2) \u201cThose improvements, besides, are not always made by the stock of the landlord, but sometimes by that of the tenant. When the lease comes to be renewed, however, the landlord commonly demands the same augmentation of rent as if they had been all made by his own.\u201d (3) \u201cHe sometimes demands rent for what is altogether incapable of human improvement.\u201d (Adam Smith, op. cit., Vol. I, p. 131) Smith's critiques of the benefit to society from landlords thus played a key role in Marx's economic, political, and philosophical theories. <ref> https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/marx\/works\/1844\/manuscripts\/rent.htm<\/ref>\n\n== Owner and tenant ==\nA [[rental agreement]], or ''lease'', is the [[contract]] defining such terms as the price paid, penalties for late payments, the length of the rental or lease, and the amount of notice required before either the homeowner or tenant cancels the agreement.  In general, responsibilities are given as follows: the homeowner is responsible for making repairs and performing property maintenance, and the tenant is responsible for keeping the property clean and safe.\n\nMany owners hire a [[property management]] company to take care of all the details of renting their property out to a tenant. This usually includes advertising the property and showing it to prospective tenants, negotiating and preparing the written leases, and then, once rented, collecting rent from the tenant and performing repairs as needed.\n\n[[Image:E9438-David-Berry-monument.jpg|thumb|Being a good landlord, [[David Berry (landowner)|David Berry]] (who had owned much of what is now known as [[Berry, New South Wales|Berry - the town was named after him]]) is well remembered by his tenants.]]\n\nIn the [[United States]], homeowner\u2013tenant disputes are primarily governed by [[state law]] (not [[federal law]]) regarding [[property]] and [[contracts]].  State law and, in some places, city law or county law, sets the requirements for [[eviction]] of a tenant.  Generally, there are a limited number of reasons for which a landlord or landlady can evict his or her tenant before the expiration of the tenancy, though at the end of the lease term the rental relationship can generally be terminated without giving any reason. Some cities, counties, and States have laws establishing the maximum rent a landlord can charge, known as [[rent control]], and related [[eviction]]. There is also an [[Implied warranty of habitability#Habitability|implied warranty of habitability]], whereby a landlord must maintain safe, decent and habitable housing, meeting minimum safety requirements such as smoke detectors and a locking door.\n\n==Rental investment==\nNet income received, or losses suffered, by an investor from [[renting]] of one or two properties is subject to [[Idiosyncrasy#Idiosyncrasy in economics|idiosyncratic risk]] due to the numerous things that can happen to real property and variable behavior of tenants.<ref name=NYT032913>{{cite news|title=Rental Investment May Seem Safer Than It Really Is|url=http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2013\/03\/30\/your-money\/investing-in-a-rental-home-isnt-as-safe-as-it-may-seem.html|accessdate=March 30, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 29, 2013|author=Tara Siegel Barnard}}<\/ref>\n\nRental properties can either be paid for monthly or annually depending on the agreement between the landlord and the tenant and is always included in the lease agreement and this is one of the factors that a tenant considers before moving in.\n\n==Licensed victualler==\n{{Main|Pub}}\n\nIn the [[United Kingdom]], the owner and\/or manager of a pub, or public house, is usually called the \"landlord\/landlady\", and often, strictly incorrectly, \"[[publican]]\", the latter properly the appellation of a Roman public contractor or [[Tax farming|tax farmer]].

Many municipalities and state governments have now legislated significant codes of tenants' rights to protect tenants against unethical business practices.<ref>http:\/\/www.oag.state.ny.us\/sites\/default\/files\/pdfs\/publications\/Tenant_Rights_2011.pdf<\/ref><ref>http:\/\/www.dca.ca.gov\/publications\/landlordbook\/catenant.pdf<\/ref>\n\n== History ==\nThe concept of a landlord may be traced back to the [[feudalism|feudal]] system of [[manoralism]] ([[seignorialism]]), where a [[landed estate]] is owned by a [[Lord of the Manor]] ([[mesne lord]]s), usually members of the lower nobility which came to form the rank of [[knight]]s in the high medieval period, holding their fief via [[subinfeudation]], but in some cases the land may also be directly subject to a member of higher nobility, as in the [[royal domain]] directly owned by a king, or in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] [[Imperial Village|imperial villages]] directly subject to the emperor.\nThe medieval system ultimately continues the system of [[Roman villa|villas]] and [[latifundium|latifundia]] of the [[Roman Empire]].<ref>[http:\/\/faculty.history.wisc.edu\/sommerville\/123\/feudalism.htm Faculty.history.wisc.edu]<\/ref>\n\nSeveral extremely influential [[economic philosophy| economic philosophers]] of apparently quite divergent viewpoints have written a great deal about landlords. For example, [[Karl Marx]], the famed theorist of [[Communism]], described landlords as part of the \"[[Petite bourgeoisie]]\" and that \"the landlord exploits everything from which society benefits.\" in the ''[[Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844]]''. On the other side of the [[Political Philosophy|Political Philosophical]] spectrum, [[Adam Smith]], perhaps the greatest theorist of [[Capitalism]] to ever write, largely concurred with Marx's negative opinion of landlords, writing that  \"Landlords\u2019 right has its origin in robbery.\" (Say, t. 1, p. 136, footnote.)  Smith also stated that: \"The landlords, like all other men, love to reap where they never sowed, and demand a rent even for the natural produce of the earth. (Adam Smith, op. cit., Vol. I, p. 44.)\" Even more harshly, Smith concluded that \u201cThe rent of land, it may be thought, is frequently no more than a reasonable profit or interest for the stock laid out by the landlord upon its improvement. This, no doubt, may be partly the case upon some occasions.... The landlord demands\u201d (1) \u201ca rent even for unimproved land, and the supposed interest or profit upon the expense of improvement is generally an addition to this original rent.\u201d (2) \u201cThose improvements, besides, are not always made by the stock of the landlord, but sometimes by that of the tenant. When the lease comes to be renewed, however, the landlord commonly demands the same augmentation of rent as if they had been all made by his own.\u201d (3) \u201cHe sometimes demands rent for what is altogether incapable of human improvement.\u201d (Adam Smith, op. cit., Vol. I, p. 131) Smith's critiques of the benefit to society from landlords thus played a key role in Marx's economic, political, and philosophical theories. <ref> https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/marx\/works\/1844\/manuscripts\/rent.htm<\/ref>\n\n== Owner and tenant ==\nA [[rental agreement]], or ''lease'', is the [[contract]] defining such terms as the price paid, penalties for late payments, the length of the rental or lease, and the amount of notice required before either the homeowner or tenant cancels the agreement.

Anping, Hebei.jpg|thumb|280px|Powerful landlord in chariot. [[Eastern Han]] 25-220 CE. [[Hebei]], China.]]\nA '''landlord''' is the owner of a [[house]], [[apartment]], [[condominium]], land or [[real estate]] which is [[Renting|rent]]ed or [[lease]]d to an individual or business, who is called a [[Leasehold estate|tenant]] (also a ''lessee'' or ''renter'').  When a [[juristic person]] is in this position, the term landlord is used. Other terms include '''lessor''' and '''owner'''. The term '''landlady''' may be used for [[female]] owners, and lessor applies to both genders.  Unlike feudal [[lords]], contemporary landlords are not 'lords' in any meaningful sense. Many municipalities and state governments have now legislated significant codes of tenants' rights to protect tenants against unethical business practices.<ref>http:\/\/www.oag.state.ny.us\/sites\/default\/files\/pdfs\/publications\/Tenant_Rights_2011.pdf<\/ref><ref>http:\/\/www.dca.ca.gov\/publications\/landlordbook\/catenant.pdf<\/ref>\n\n==History==\nThe concept of a landlord may be traced back to the [[feudalism|feudal]] system of [[manoralism]] ([[seignorialism]]), where a [[landed estate]] is owned by a [[Lord of the Manor]] ([[mesne lord]]s), usually members of the lower nobility which came to form the rank of [[knight]]s in the high medieval period, holding their fief via [[subinfeudation]], but in some cases the land may also be directly subject to a member of higher nobility, as in the [[royal domain]] directly owned by a king, or in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] [[Imperial Village|imperial villages]] directly subject to the emperor.\nThe medieval system ultimately continues the system of [[Roman villa|villas]] and [[latifundium|latifundia]] of the [[Roman Empire]].<ref>[http:\/\/faculty.history.wisc.edu\/sommerville\/123\/feudalism.htm Faculty.history.wisc.edu]<\/ref>\n\nSeveral extremely influential [[economic philosophy| economic philosophers]] of seemingly quite divergent viewpoints have written a great deal about landlords. For example, [[Karl Marx]], the famed theorist of [[Communism]], described landlords as part of the \"[[Petite bourgeoisie]]\" and that \"the landlord exploits everything from which society benefits.\" in the ''[[Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844]]''. On the other side of the [[Political Philosophy|Political Philosophical]] spectrum, [[Adam Smith]], perhaps the greatest theorist of [[Capitalism]] to ever write, largely concurred with Marx's negative opinion of landlords, writing that  \"Landlords\u2019 right has its origin in robbery.\" (Say, t. 1, p. 136, footnote.)  Smith also stated that: \"The landlords, like all other men, love to reap where they never sowed, and demand a rent even for the natural produce of the earth. (Adam Smith, op. cit., Vol. I, p. 44.)\" Even more harshly, Smith concluded that \u201cThe rent of land, it may be thought, is frequently no more than a reasonable profit or interest for the stock laid out by the landlord upon its improvement. This, no doubt, may be partly the case upon some occasions.... The landlord demands\u201d (1) \u201ca rent even for unimproved land, and the supposed interest or profit upon the expense of improvement is generally an addition to this original rent.\u201d (2) \u201cThose improvements, besides, are not always made by the stock of the landlord, but sometimes by that of the tenant. When the lease comes to be renewed, however, the landlord commonly demands the same augmentation of rent as if they had been all made by his own.\u201d (3) \u201cHe sometimes demands rent for what is altogether incapable of human improvement.\u201d (Adam Smith, op. cit., Vol. I, p. 131) Smith's critiques of the benefit to society from landlords thus played a key role in Marx's economic, political, and philosophical theories. <ref> https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/marx\/works\/1844\/manuscripts\/rent.htm<\/ref>\n\n==Owner and tenant==\nA [[rental agreement]], or ''lease'', is the [[contract]] defining such terms as the price paid, penalties for late payments, the length of the rental or lease, and the amount of notice required before either the homeowner or tenant cancels the agreement.  In general, responsibilities are given as follows: the homeowner is responsible for making repairs and performing property maintenance, and the tenant is responsible for keeping the property clean and safe.\n\nMany owners hire a [[property management]] company to take care of all the details of renting their property out to a tenant. This usually includes advertising the property and showing it to prospective tenants, negotiating and preparing the written leases, and then, once rented, collecting rent from the tenant and performing repairs as needed.\n\n[[Image:E9438-David-Berry-monument.jpg|thumb|Being a good landlord, [[David Berry (landowner)|David Berry]] (who had owned much of what is now known as [[Berry, New South Wales|Berry - the town was named after him]]) is well remembered by his tenants.]]\n\nIn the [[United States]], homeowner\u2013tenant disputes are primarily governed by [[state law]] (not [[federal law]]) regarding [[property]] and [[contracts]].  State law and, in some places, city law or county law, sets the requirements for [[eviction]] of a tenant.  Generally, there are a limited number of reasons for which a landlord or landlady can evict his or her tenant before the expiration of the tenancy, though at the end of the lease term the rental relationship can generally be terminated without giving any reason. Some cities, counties, and States have laws establishing the maximum rent a landlord can charge, known as [[rent control]], and related [[eviction]]. There is also an [[Implied warranty of habitability#Habitability|implied warranty of habitability]], whereby a landlord must maintain safe, decent and habitable housing, meeting minimum safety requirements such as smoke detectors and a locking door.\n\n==Rental investment==\nNet income received, or losses suffered, by an investor from [[renting]] of one or two properties is subject to [[Idiosyncrasy#Idiosyncrasy in economics|idiosyncratic risk]] due to the numerous things that can happen to real property and variable behavior of tenants.<ref name=NYT032913>{{cite news|title=Rental Investment May Seem Safer Than It Really Is|url=http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2013\/03\/30\/your-money\/investing-in-a-rental-home-isnt-as-safe-as-it-may-seem.html|accessdate=March 30, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 29, 2013|author=Tara Siegel Barnard}}<\/ref>\n\nRental properties can either be paid for monthly or annually depending on the agreement between the landlord and the tenant and is always included in the lease agreement and this is one of the factors that a tenant considers before moving in.\n\n==Licensed victualler==\n{{Main|Pub}}\n\nIn the [[United Kingdom]], the owner and\/or manager of a pub, or public house, is usually called the \"landlord\/landlady\", and often, strictly incorrectly, \"[[publican]]\", the latter properly the appellation of a Roman public contractor or [[Tax farming|tax farmer]].

Anping, Hebei.jpg|thumb|280px|Powerful landlord in chariot. [[Eastern Han]] 25-220 CE. [[Hebei]], China.]]\nA '''landlord''' is the owner of a [[house]], [[apartment]], [[condominium]], land or [[real estate]] which is [[Renting|rent]]ed or [[lease]]d to an individual or business, who is called a [[Leasehold estate|tenant]] (also a ''lessee'' or ''renter'').  When a [[juristic person]] is in this position, the term landlord is used. Other terms include '''lessor''' and '''owner'''. The term '''landlady''' may be used for [[female]] owners, and lessor applies to both genders.  \n\n==History==\nThe concept of a landlord may be traced back to the [[feudalism|feudal]] system of [[manoralism]] ([[seignorialism]]), where a [[landed estate]] is owned by a [[Lord of the Manor]] ([[mesne lord]]s), usually members of the lower nobility which came to form the rank of [[knight]]s in the high medieval period, holding their fief via [[subinfeudation]], but in some cases the land may also be directly subject to a member of higher nobility, as in the [[royal domain]] directly owned by a king, or in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] [[Imperial Village|imperial villages]] directly subject to the emperor.\nThe medieval system ultimately continues the system of [[Roman villa|villas]] and [[latifundium|latifundia]] of the [[Roman Empire]].<ref>[http:\/\/faculty.history.wisc.edu\/sommerville\/123\/feudalism.htm Faculty.history.wisc.edu]<\/ref>\n\nSeveral extremely influential [[economic philosophy| economic philosophers]] of seemingly quite divergent viewpoints have written a great deal about landlords. For example, [[Karl Marx]], the famed theorist of [[Communism]], described landlords as part of the \"[[Petite bourgeoisie]]\" and that \"the landlord exploits everything from which society benefits.\" in the ''[[Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844]]''. On the other side of the [[Political Philosophy|Political Philosophical]] spectrum, [[Adam Smith]], perhaps the greatest theorist of [[Capitalism]] to ever write, largely concurred with Marx's negative opinion of landlords, writing that  \"Landlords\u2019 right has its origin in robbery.\" (Say, t. 1, p. 136, footnote.)  Smith also stated that: \"The landlords, like all other men, love to reap where they never sowed, and demand a rent even for the natural produce of the earth. (Adam Smith, op. cit., Vol. I, p. 44.)\" Even more harshly, Smith concluded that \u201cThe rent of land, it may be thought, is frequently no more than a reasonable profit or interest for the stock laid out by the landlord upon its improvement. This, no doubt, may be partly the case upon some occasions.... The landlord demands\u201d (1) \u201ca rent even for unimproved land, and the supposed interest or profit upon the expense of improvement is generally an addition to this original rent.\u201d (2) \u201cThose improvements, besides, are not always made by the stock of the landlord, but sometimes by that of the tenant. When the lease comes to be renewed, however, the landlord commonly demands the same augmentation of rent as if they had been all made by his own.\u201d (3) \u201cHe sometimes demands rent for what is altogether incapable of human improvement.\u201d (Adam Smith, op. cit., Vol. I, p. 131) Smith's critiques of the benefit to society from landlords thus played a key role in Marx's economic, political, and philosophical theories. <ref> https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/marx\/works\/1844\/manuscripts\/rent.htm<\/ref>\n\n==Owner and tenant==\nA [[rental agreement]], or ''lease'', is the [[contract]] defining such terms as the price paid, penalties for late payments, the length of the rental or lease, and the amount of notice required before either the homeowner or tenant cancels the agreement.  In general, responsibilities are given as follows: the homeowner is responsible for making repairs and performing property maintenance, and the tenant is responsible for keeping the property clean and safe.\n\nMany owners hire a [[property management]] company to take care of all the details of renting their property out to a tenant. This usually includes advertising the property and showing it to prospective tenants, negotiating and preparing the written leases, and then, once rented, collecting rent from the tenant and performing repairs as needed.\n\n[[Image:E9438-David-Berry-monument.jpg|thumb|Being a good landlord, [[David Berry (landowner)|David Berry]] (who had owned much of what is now known as [[Berry, New South Wales|Berry - the town was named after him]]) is well remembered by his tenants.]]\n\nIn the [[United States]], homeowner\u2013tenant disputes are primarily governed by [[state law]] (not [[federal law]]) regarding [[property]] and [[contracts]].  State law and, in some places, city law or county law, sets the requirements for [[eviction]] of a tenant.  Generally, there are a limited number of reasons for which a landlord or landlady can evict his or her tenant before the expiration of the tenancy, though at the end of the lease term the rental relationship can generally be terminated without giving any reason. Some cities, counties, and States have laws establishing the maximum rent a landlord can charge, known as [[rent control]], and related [[eviction]]. There is also an [[Implied warranty of habitability#Habitability|implied warranty of habitability]], whereby a landlord must maintain safe, decent and habitable housing, meeting minimum safety requirements such as smoke detectors and a locking door.\n\n==Rental investment==\nNet income received, or losses suffered, by an investor from [[renting]] of one or two properties is subject to [[Idiosyncrasy#Idiosyncrasy in economics|idiosyncratic risk]] due to the numerous things that can happen to real property and variable behavior of tenants.<ref name=NYT032913>{{cite news|title=Rental Investment May Seem Safer Than It Really Is|url=http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2013\/03\/30\/your-money\/investing-in-a-rental-home-isnt-as-safe-as-it-may-seem.html|accessdate=March 30, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 29, 2013|author=Tara Siegel Barnard}}<\/ref>\n\nRental properties can either be paid for monthly or annually depending on the agreement between the landlord and the tenant and is always included in the lease agreement and this is one of the factors that a tenant considers before moving in.\n\n==Licensed victualler==\n{{Main|Pub}}\n\nIn the [[United Kingdom]], the owner and\/or manager of a pub, or public house, is usually called the \"landlord\/landlady\", and often, strictly incorrectly, \"[[publican]]\", the latter properly the appellation of a Roman public contractor or [[Tax farming|tax farmer]]. In a more formal situations, the term used is '''licensed victualler''' or simply \"licensee\".<ref name='Dictionary.com'>{{cite web|url=http:\/\/dictionary.reference.com\/browse\/victualler |title= Dictionary.com |accessdate=2008-07-19 }}<\/ref> A female landlord can either be called a ''landlady'' or simply landlord.\n\nThe [[Licensed Trade Charity]], formed in 2004 from the merger of the Society of Licensed Victuallers and Licensed Victualler's National Homes,<ref>{{EW charity|230011|Society of Licensed Victuallers}}<\/ref> exists to serve the retirement needs of Britain's pub landlords. The charity also runs three private schools in [[Ascot, Berkshire|Ascot]] and [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]] in [[Berkshire]] and [[Sayers Common]] in [[Sussex]]. As well as having normal full fee paying students, [[Licensed Victuallers' School]] in Ascot provides discounted education prices for the children of landlords and others in the catering industry.\n\n==Landlord policing responsibilities==\n\nIn some American cities, city government working with neighborhood activists has blamed landlords for crime, especially in the inner city. Punishment comes in the form of revoked rental licenses when city inspectors have identified a certain number of criminal incidents associated with buildings.  Some landlords, especially in [[Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul]], have successfully organized against this type of politics.<ref>[http:\/\/www.landlordpolitics.com Landorpolitics.com]<\/ref>\n\n==References==\n{{wiktionary|landlord}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Real estate}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n[[Category:Real estate]]\n[[Category:Real property law]]",

Anping, Hebei.jpg|thumb|280px|Powerful landlord in chariot. [[Eastern Han]] 25-220 CE. [[Hebei]], China.]]\nA '''landlord''' is the owner of a [[house]], [[apartment]], [[condominium]], land or [[real estate]] which is [[Renting|rent]]ed or [[lease]]d to an individual or business, who is called a [[Leasehold estate|tenant]] (also a ''lessee'' or ''renter'').  When a [[juristic person]] is in this position, the term landlord is used. Other terms include '''lessor''' and '''owner'''. The term '''landlady''' may be used for [[female]] owners, and lessor applies to both genders.  The term 'landlord' historically derives from the economic system of [[feudalism]], a system of [[slavery|bonded labor.]] Unlike feudal [[lords]], contemporary landlords are not 'lords' in any meaningful sense. Many municipalities and state governments have now legislated significant codes of tenants' rights to protect tenants against unethical business practices.<ref>http:\/\/www.oag.state.ny.us\/sites\/default\/files\/pdfs\/publications\/Tenant_Rights_2011.pdf<\/ref><ref>http:\/\/www.dca.ca.gov\/publications\/landlordbook\/catenant.pdf<\/ref>\n\n==History==\nThe concept of a landlord may be traced back to the [[feudalism|feudal]] system of [[manoralism]] ([[seignorialism]]), where a [[landed estate]] is owned by a [[Lord of the Manor]] ([[mesne lord]]s), usually members of the lower nobility which came to form the rank of [[knight]]s in the high medieval period, holding their fief via [[subinfeudation]], but in some cases the land may also be directly subject to a member of higher nobility, as in the [[royal domain]] directly owned by a king, or in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] [[Imperial Village|imperial villages]] directly subject to the emperor.\nThe medieval system ultimately continues the system of [[Roman villa|villas]] and [[latifundium|latifundia]] of the [[Roman Empire]].<ref>[http:\/\/faculty.history.wisc.edu\/sommerville\/123\/feudalism.htm Faculty.history.wisc.edu]<\/ref>\n\n==Owner and tenant==\nA [[rental agreement]], or ''lease'', is the [[contract]] defining such terms as the price paid, penalties for late payments, the length of the rental or lease, and the amount of notice required before either the homeowner or tenant cancels the agreement.  In general, responsibilities are given as follows: the homeowner is responsible for making repairs and performing property maintenance, and the tenant is responsible for keeping the property clean and safe.\n\nMany owners hire a [[property management]] company to take care of all the details of renting their property out to a tenant. This usually includes advertising the property and showing it to prospective tenants, negotiating and preparing the written leases, and then, once rented, collecting rent from the tenant and performing repairs as needed.\n\n[[Image:E9438-David-Berry-monument.jpg|thumb|Being a good landlord, [[David Berry (landowner)|David Berry]] (who had owned much of what is now known as [[Berry, New South Wales|Berry - the town was named after him]]) is well remembered by his tenants.]]\n\nIn the [[United States]], homeowner\u2013tenant disputes are primarily governed by [[state law]] (not [[federal law]]) regarding [[property]] and [[contracts]].  State law and, in some places, city law or county law, sets the requirements for [[eviction]] of a tenant.  Generally, there are a limited number of reasons for which a landlord or landlady can evict his or her tenant before the expiration of the tenancy, though at the end of the lease term the rental relationship can generally be terminated without giving any reason. Some cities, counties, and States have laws establishing the maximum rent a landlord can charge, known as [[rent control]], and related [[eviction]]. There is also an [[Implied warranty of habitability#Habitability|implied warranty of habitability]], whereby a landlord must maintain safe, decent and habitable housing, meeting minimum safety requirements such as smoke detectors and a locking door.\n\n==Rental investment==\nNet income received, or losses suffered, by an investor from [[renting]] of one or two properties is subject to [[Idiosyncrasy#Idiosyncrasy in economics|idiosyncratic risk]] due to the numerous things that can happen to real property and variable behavior of tenants.<ref name=NYT032913>{{cite news|title=Rental Investment May Seem Safer Than It Really Is|url=http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2013\/03\/30\/your-money\/investing-in-a-rental-home-isnt-as-safe-as-it-may-seem.html|accessdate=March 30, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 29, 2013|author=Tara Siegel Barnard}}<\/ref>\n\nRental properties can either be paid for monthly or annually depending on the agreement between the landlord and the tenant and is always included in the lease agreement and this is one of the factors that a tenant considers before moving in.\n\n==Licensed victualler==\n{{Main|Pub}}\n\nIn the [[United Kingdom]], the owner and\/or manager of a pub, or public house, is usually called the \"landlord\/landlady\", and often, strictly incorrectly, \"[[publican]]\", the latter properly the appellation of a Roman public contractor or [[Tax farming|tax farmer]].

Anping, Hebei.jpg|thumb|280px|Powerful landlord in chariot. [[Eastern Han]] 25-220 CE. [[Hebei]], China.]]\nA '''landlord''' is the owner of a [[house]], [[apartment]], [[condominium]], land or [[real estate]] which is [[Renting|rent]]ed or [[lease]]d to an individual or business, who is called a [[Leasehold estate|tenant]] (also a ''lessee'' or ''renter'').  When a [[juristic person]] is in this position, the term landlord is used. Other terms include '''lessor''' and '''owner'''. The term '''landlady''' may be used for [[female]] owners, and lessor applies to both genders.  The term 'landlord' historically derives from the economic system of [[feudalism]], a system of [[slavery|bonded labor.]] Unlike feudal [[lords]], contemporary landlords are not 'lords' in any meaningful sense. Many municipalities and state governments have now legislated significant codes of tenants' rights to protect tenants against unethical business practices.<ref>http:\/\/www.oag.state.ny.us\/sites\/default\/files\/pdfs\/publications\/Tenant_Rights_2011.pdf<\/ref><ref>http:\/\/www.dca.ca.gov\/publications\/landlordbook\/catenant.pdf<\/ref>\n\n==History==\nThe concept of a landlord may be traced back to the [[feudalism|feudal]] system of [[manoralism]] ([[seignorialism]]), where a [[landed estate]] is owned by a [[Lord of the Manor]] ([[mesne lord]]s), usually members of the lower nobility which came to form the rank of [[knight]]s in the high medieval period, holding their fief via [[subinfeudation]], but in some cases the land may also be directly subject to a member of higher nobility, as in the [[royal domain]] directly owned by a king, or in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] [[Imperial Village|imperial villages]] directly subject to the emperor.\nThe medieval system ultimately continues the system of [[Roman villa|villas]] and [[latifundium|latifundia]] of the [[Roman Empire]].<ref>[http:\/\/faculty.history.wisc.edu\/sommerville\/123\/feudalism.htm Faculty.history.wisc.edu]<\/ref>\n\nSeveral extremely influential [[economic philosophy| economic philosophers]] of seemingly quite divergent viewpoints have written a great deal about landlords. For example, [[Karl Marx]], the famed theorist of [[Communism]], described landlords as part of the \"[[Petite bourgeoisie]]\" and that \"the landlord exploits everything from which society benefits.\" in the ''[[Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844]]''. On the other side of the [[Political Philosophy|Political Philosophical]] spectrum, [[Adam Smith]], perhaps the greatest theorist of [[Capitalism]] to ever write, largely concurred with Marx's negative opinion of landlords, writing that  \"Landlords\u2019 right has its origin in robbery.\" (Say, t. 1, p. 136, footnote.)  Smith also stated that: \"The landlords, like all other men, love to reap where they never sowed, and demand a rent even for the natural produce of the earth. (Adam Smith, op. cit., Vol. I, p. 44.)\" Even more harshly, Smith concluded that \u201cThe rent of land, it may be thought, is frequently no more than a reasonable profit or interest for the stock laid out by the landlord upon its improvement. This, no doubt, may be partly the case upon some occasions.... The landlord demands\u201d (1) \u201ca rent even for unimproved land, and the supposed interest or profit upon the expense of improvement is generally an addition to this original rent.\u201d (2) \u201cThose improvements, besides, are not always made by the stock of the landlord, but sometimes by that of the tenant. When the lease comes to be renewed, however, the landlord commonly demands the same augmentation of rent as if they had been all made by his own.\u201d (3) \u201cHe sometimes demands rent for what is altogether incapable of human improvement.\u201d (Adam Smith, op. cit., Vol. I, p. 131) Smith's critiques of the benefit to society from landlords thus played a key role in Marx's economic, political, and philosophical theories. <ref> https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/marx\/works\/1844\/manuscripts\/rent.htm<\/ref>\n\n==Owner and tenant==\nA [[rental agreement]], or ''lease'', is the [[contract]] defining such terms as the price paid, penalties for late payments, the length of the rental or lease, and the amount of notice required before either the homeowner or tenant cancels the agreement.  In general, responsibilities are given as follows: the homeowner is responsible for making repairs and performing property maintenance, and the tenant is responsible for keeping the property clean and safe.\n\nMany owners hire a [[property management]] company to take care of all the details of renting their property out to a tenant. This usually includes advertising the property and showing it to prospective tenants, negotiating and preparing the written leases, and then, once rented, collecting rent from the tenant and performing repairs as needed.\n\n[[Image:E9438-David-Berry-monument.jpg|thumb|Being a good landlord, [[David Berry (landowner)|David Berry]] (who had owned much of what is now known as [[Berry, New South Wales|Berry - the town was named after him]]) is well remembered by his tenants.]]\n\nIn the [[United States]], homeowner\u2013tenant disputes are primarily governed by [[state law]] (not [[federal law]]) regarding [[property]] and [[contracts]].  State law and, in some places, city law or county law, sets the requirements for [[eviction]] of a tenant.  Generally, there are a limited number of reasons for which a landlord or landlady can evict his or her tenant before the expiration of the tenancy, though at the end of the lease term the rental relationship can generally be terminated without giving any reason. Some cities, counties, and States have laws establishing the maximum rent a landlord can charge, known as [[rent control]], and related [[eviction]]. There is also an [[Implied warranty of habitability#Habitability|implied warranty of habitability]], whereby a landlord must maintain safe, decent and habitable housing, meeting minimum safety requirements such as smoke detectors and a locking door.\n\n==Rental investment==\nNet income received, or losses suffered, by an investor from [[renting]] of one or two properties is subject to [[Idiosyncrasy#Idiosyncrasy in economics|idiosyncratic risk]] due to the numerous things that can happen to real property and variable behavior of tenants.<ref name=NYT032913>{{cite news|title=Rental Investment May Seem Safer Than It Really Is|url=http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2013\/03\/30\/your-money\/investing-in-a-rental-home-isnt-as-safe-as-it-may-seem.html|accessdate=March 30, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 29, 2013|author=Tara Siegel Barnard}}<\/ref>\n\nRental properties can either be paid for monthly or annually depending on the agreement between the landlord and the tenant and is always included in the lease agreement and this is one of the factors that a tenant considers before moving in.\n\n==Licensed victualler==\n{{Main|Pub}}\n\nIn the [[United Kingdom]], the owner and\/or manager of a pub, or public house, is usually called the \"landlord\/landlady\", and often, strictly incorrectly, \"[[publican]]\", the latter properly the appellation of a Roman public contractor or [[Tax farming|tax farmer]]. In a more formal situations, the term used is '''licensed victualler''' or simply \"licensee\".<ref name='Dictionary.com'>{{cite web|url=http:\/\/dictionary.reference.com\/browse\/victualler |title= Dictionary.com |accessdate=2008-07-19 }}<\/ref> A female landlord can either be called a ''landlady'' or simply landlord.\n\nThe [[Licensed Trade Charity]], formed in 2004 from the merger of the Society of Licensed Victuallers and Licensed Victualler's National Homes,<ref>{{EW charity|230011|Society of Licensed Victuallers}}<\/ref> exists to serve the retirement needs of Britain's pub landlords. The charity also runs three private schools in [[Ascot, Berkshire|Ascot]] and [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]] in [[Berkshire]] and [[Sayers Common]] in [[Sussex]]. As well as having normal full fee paying students, [[Licensed Victuallers' School]] in Ascot provides discounted education prices for the children of landlords and others in the catering industry.\n\n==Landlord policing responsibilities==\n\nIn some American cities, city government working with neighborhood activists has blamed landlords for crime, especially in the inner city. Punishment comes in the form of revoked rental licenses when city inspectors have identified a certain number of criminal incidents associated with buildings.  Some landlords, especially in [[Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul]], have successfully organized against this type of politics.<ref>[http:\/\/www.landlordpolitics.com Landorpolitics.com]<\/ref>\n\n==References==\n{{wiktionary|landlord}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Real estate}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n[[Category:Real estate]]\n[[Category:Real property law]]",

Anping, Hebei.jpg|thumb|280px|Powerful landlord in chariot. [[Eastern Han]] 25-220 CE. [[Hebei]], China.]]\nA '''landlord''' is the owner of a [[house]], [[apartment]], [[condominium]], land or [[real estate]] which is [[Renting|rent]]ed or [[lease]]d to an individual or business, who is called a [[Leasehold estate|tenant]] (also a ''lessee'' or ''renter'').  When a [[juristic person]] is in this position, the term landlord is used. Other terms include '''lessor''' and '''owner'''. The term '''landlady''' may be used for [[female]] owners, and lessor applies to both genders.  \n\n==History==\nThe concept of a landlord may be traced back to the [[feudalism|feudal]] system of [[manoralism]] ([[seignorialism]]), where a [[landed estate]] is owned by a [[Lord of the Manor]] ([[mesne lord]]s), usually members of the lower nobility which came to form the rank of [[knight]]s in the high medieval period, holding their fief via [[subinfeudation]], but in some cases the land may also be directly subject to a member of higher nobility, as in the [[royal domain]] directly owned by a king, or in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] [[Imperial Village|imperial villages]] directly subject to the emperor.\nThe medieval system ultimately continues the system of [[Roman villa|villas]] and [[latifundium|latifundia]] of the [[Roman Empire]].<ref>[http:\/\/faculty.history.wisc.edu\/sommerville\/123\/feudalism.htm Faculty.history.wisc.edu]<\/ref>\n\n==Owner and tenant==\nA [[rental agreement]], or ''lease'', is the [[contract]] defining such terms as the price paid, penalties for late payments, the length of the rental or lease, and the amount of notice required before either the homeowner or tenant cancels the agreement.  In general, responsibilities are given as follows: the homeowner is responsible for making repairs and performing property maintenance, and the tenant is responsible for keeping the property clean and safe.\n\nMany owners hire a [[property management]] company to take care of all the details of renting their property out to a tenant. This usually includes advertising the property and showing it to prospective tenants, negotiating and preparing the written leases, and then, once rented, collecting rent from the tenant and performing repairs as needed.\n\n[[Image:E9438-David-Berry-monument.jpg|thumb|Being a good landlord, [[David Berry (landowner)|David Berry]] (who had owned much of what is now known as [[Berry, New South Wales|Berry - the town was named after him]]) is well remembered by his tenants.]]\n\nIn the [[United States]], homeowner\u2013tenant disputes are primarily governed by [[state law]] (not [[federal law]]) regarding [[property]] and [[contracts]].  State law and, in some places, city law or county law, sets the requirements for [[eviction]] of a tenant.  Generally, there are a limited number of reasons for which a landlord or landlady can evict his or her tenant before the expiration of the tenancy, though at the end of the lease term the rental relationship can generally be terminated without giving any reason. Some cities, counties, and States have laws establishing the maximum rent a landlord can charge, known as [[rent control]], and related [[eviction]]. There is also an [[Implied warranty of habitability#Habitability|implied warranty of habitability]], whereby a landlord must maintain safe, decent and habitable housing, meeting minimum safety requirements such as smoke detectors and a locking door.\n\n==Rental investment==\nNet income received, or losses suffered, by an investor from [[renting]] of one or two properties is subject to [[Idiosyncrasy#Idiosyncrasy in economics|idiosyncratic risk]] due to the numerous things that can happen to real property and variable behavior of tenants.<ref name=NYT032913>{{cite news|title=Rental Investment May Seem Safer Than It Really Is|url=http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2013\/03\/30\/your-money\/investing-in-a-rental-home-isnt-as-safe-as-it-may-seem.html|accessdate=March 30, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 29, 2013|author=Tara Siegel Barnard}}<\/ref>\n\nRental properties can either be paid for monthly or annually depending on the agreement between the landlord and the tenant and is always included in the lease agreement and this is one of the factors that a tenant considers before moving in.\n\n==Licensed victualler==\n{{Main|Pub}}\n\nIn the [[United Kingdom]], the owner and\/or manager of a pub, or public house, is usually called the \"landlord\/landlady\", and often, strictly incorrectly, \"[[publican]]\", the latter properly the appellation of a Roman public contractor or [[Tax farming|tax farmer]]. In a more formal situations, the term used is '''licensed victualler''' or simply \"licensee\".<ref name='Dictionary.com'>{{cite web|url=http:\/\/dictionary.reference.com\/browse\/victualler |title= Dictionary.com |accessdate=2008-07-19 }}<\/ref> A female landlord can either be called a ''landlady'' or simply landlord.\n\nThe [[Licensed Trade Charity]], formed in 2004 from the merger of the Society of Licensed Victuallers and Licensed Victualler's National Homes,<ref>{{EW charity|230011|Society of Licensed Victuallers}}<\/ref> exists to serve the retirement needs of Britain's pub landlords. The charity also runs three private schools in [[Ascot, Berkshire|Ascot]] and [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]] in [[Berkshire]] and [[Sayers Common]] in [[Sussex]]. As well as having normal full fee paying students, [[Licensed Victuallers' School]] in Ascot provides discounted education prices for the children of landlords and others in the catering industry.\n\n==Landlord policing responsibilities==\n\nIn some American cities, city government working with neighborhood activists has blamed landlords for crime, especially in the inner city. Punishment comes in the form of revoked rental licenses when city inspectors have identified a certain number of criminal incidents associated with buildings.  Some landlords, especially in [[Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul]], have successfully organized against this type of politics.<ref>[http:\/\/www.landlordpolitics.com Landorpolitics.com]<\/ref>\n\n==References==\n{{wiktionary|landlord}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Real estate}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n[[Category:Real estate]]\n[[Category:Real property law]]",

Anping, Hebei.jpg|thumb|280px|Powerful landlord in chariot. [[Eastern Han]] 25-220 CE. [[Hebei]], China.]]\nA '''landlord''' is the owner of a [[house]], [[apartment]], [[condominium]], land or [[real estate]] which is [[Renting|rent]]ed or [[lease]]d to an individual or business, who is called a [[Leasehold estate|tenant]] (also a ''lessee'' or ''renter'').  When a [[juristic person]] is in this position, the term landlord is used. Other terms include '''lessor''' and '''owner'''. The term '''landlady''' may be used for [[female]] owners, and lessor applies to both genders.  The term 'landlord' historically derives from the economic system of [[feudalism]], a system of [[slavery|bonded labor.]] Unlike feudal [[lords]], contemporary landlords are not 'lords' in any meaningful sense. Many municipalities and state governments have now legislated significant codes of tenants' rights to protect tenants against unethical business practices.<ref>http:\/\/www.oag.state.ny.us\/sites\/default\/files\/pdfs\/publications\/Tenant_Rights_2011.pdf<\/ref><ref>http:\/\/www.dca.ca.gov\/publications\/landlordbook\/catenant.pdf<\/ref>\n\n==History==\nThe concept of a landlord may be traced back to the [[feudalism|feudal]] system of [[manoralism]] ([[seignorialism]]), where a [[landed estate]] is owned by a [[Lord of the Manor]] ([[mesne lord]]s), usually members of the lower nobility which came to form the rank of [[knight]]s in the high medieval period, holding their fief via [[subinfeudation]], but in some cases the land may also be directly subject to a member of higher nobility, as in the [[royal domain]] directly owned by a king, or in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] [[Imperial Village|imperial villages]] directly subject to the emperor.\nThe medieval system ultimately continues the system of [[Roman villa|villas]] and [[latifundium|latifundia]] of the [[Roman Empire]].<ref>[http:\/\/faculty.history.wisc.edu\/sommerville\/123\/feudalism.htm Faculty.history.wisc.edu]<\/ref>\n\nSeveral extremely influential [[economic philosophy| economic philosophers]] of seemingly quite divergent viewpoints have written a great deal about landlords. For example, [[Karl Marx]], the famed theorist of [[Communism]], described landlords as part of the \"[[Petite bourgeoisie]]\" and that \"the landlord exploits everything from which society benefits.\" in the ''[[Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844]]''. On the other side of the [[Political Philosophy|Political Philosophical]] spectrum, [[Adam Smith]], perhaps the greatest theorist of [[Capitalism]] to ever write, largely concurred with Marx's negative opinion of landlords, writing that  \"Landlords\u2019 right has its origin in robbery.\" (Say, t. 1, p. 136, footnote.)  Smith also stated that: \"The landlords, like all other men, love to reap where they never sowed, and demand a rent even for the natural produce of the earth. (Adam Smith, op. cit., Vol. I, p. 44.)\" Even more harshly, Smith concluded that \u201cThe rent of land, it may be thought, is frequently no more than a reasonable profit or interest for the stock laid out by the landlord upon its improvement. This, no doubt, may be partly the case upon some occasions.... The landlord demands\u201d (1) \u201ca rent even for unimproved land, and the supposed interest or profit upon the expense of improvement is generally an addition to this original rent.\u201d (2) \u201cThose improvements, besides, are not always made by the stock of the landlord, but sometimes by that of the tenant. When the lease comes to be renewed, however, the landlord commonly demands the same augmentation of rent as if they had been all made by his own.\u201d (3) \u201cHe sometimes demands rent for what is altogether incapable of human improvement.\u201d (Adam Smith, op. cit., Vol. I, p. 131) Smith's critiques of the benefit to society from landlords thus played a key role in Marx's economic, political, and philosophical theories. <ref> https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/marx\/works\/1844\/manuscripts\/rent.htm<\/ref>\n\n==Owner and tenant==\nA [[rental agreement]], or ''lease'', is the [[contract]] defining such terms as the price paid, penalties for late payments, the length of the rental or lease, and the amount of notice required before either the homeowner or tenant cancels the agreement.  In general, responsibilities are given as follows: the homeowner is responsible for making repairs and performing property maintenance, and the tenant is responsible for keeping the property clean and safe.\n\nMany owners hire a [[property management]] company to take care of all the details of renting their property out to a tenant. This usually includes advertising the property and showing it to prospective tenants, negotiating and preparing the written leases, and then, once rented, collecting rent from the tenant and performing repairs as needed.\n\n[[Image:E9438-David-Berry-monument.jpg|thumb|Being a good landlord, [[David Berry (landowner)|David Berry]] (who had owned much of what is now known as [[Berry, New South Wales|Berry - the town was named after him]]) is well remembered by his tenants.]]\n\nIn the [[United States]], homeowner\u2013tenant disputes are primarily governed by [[state law]] (not [[federal law]]) regarding [[property]] and [[contracts]].  State law and, in some places, city law or county law, sets the requirements for [[eviction]] of a tenant.  Generally, there are a limited number of reasons for which a landlord or landlady can evict his or her tenant before the expiration of the tenancy, though at the end of the lease term the rental relationship can generally be terminated without giving any reason. Some cities, counties, and States have laws establishing the maximum rent a landlord can charge, known as [[rent control]], and related [[eviction]]. There is also an [[Implied warranty of habitability#Habitability|implied warranty of habitability]], whereby a landlord must maintain safe, decent and habitable housing, meeting minimum safety requirements such as smoke detectors and a locking door.\n\n==Rental investment==\nNet income received, or losses suffered, by an investor from [[renting]] of one or two properties is subject to [[Idiosyncrasy#Idiosyncrasy in economics|idiosyncratic risk]] due to the numerous things that can happen to real property and variable behavior of tenants.<ref name=NYT032913>{{cite news|title=Rental Investment May Seem Safer Than It Really Is|url=http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2013\/03\/30\/your-money\/investing-in-a-rental-home-isnt-as-safe-as-it-may-seem.html|accessdate=March 30, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 29, 2013|author=Tara Siegel Barnard}}<\/ref>\n\nRental properties can either be paid for monthly or annually depending on the agreement between the landlord and the tenant and is always included in the lease agreement and this is one of the factors that a tenant considers before moving in.\n\n==Licensed victualler==\n{{Main|Pub}}\n\nIn the [[United Kingdom]], the owner and\/or manager of a pub, or public house, is usually called the \"landlord\/landlady\", and often, strictly incorrectly, \"[[publican]]\", the latter properly the appellation of a Roman public contractor or [[Tax farming|tax farmer]]. In a more formal situations, the term used is '''licensed victualler''' or simply \"licensee\".<ref name='Dictionary.com'>{{cite web|url=http:\/\/dictionary.reference.com\/browse\/victualler |title= Dictionary.com |accessdate=2008-07-19 }}<\/ref> A female landlord can either be called a ''landlady'' or simply landlord.\n\nThe [[Licensed Trade Charity]], formed in 2004 from the merger of the Society of Licensed Victuallers and Licensed Victualler's National Homes,<ref>{{EW charity|230011|Society of Licensed Victuallers}}<\/ref> exists to serve the retirement needs of Britain's pub landlords. The charity also runs three private schools in [[Ascot, Berkshire|Ascot]] and [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]] in [[Berkshire]] and [[Sayers Common]] in [[Sussex]]. As well as having normal full fee paying students, [[Licensed Victuallers' School]] in Ascot provides discounted education prices for the children of landlords and others in the catering industry.\n\n==Landlord policing responsibilities==\n\nIn some American cities, city government working with neighborhood activists has blamed landlords for crime, especially in the inner city. Punishment comes in the form of revoked rental licenses when city inspectors have identified a certain number of criminal incidents associated with buildings.  Some landlords, especially in [[Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul]], have successfully organized against this type of politics.<ref>[http:\/\/www.landlordpolitics.com Landorpolitics.com]<\/ref>\n\n==References==\n{{wiktionary|landlord}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Real estate}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n[[Category:Real estate]]\n[[Category:Real property law]]",

Anping, Hebei.jpg|thumb|280px|Powerful landlord in chariot. [[Eastern Han]] 25-220 CE. [[Hebei]], China.]]\nA '''landlord''' is the owner of a [[house]], [[apartment]], [[condominium]], land or [[real estate]] which is [[Renting|rent]]ed or [[lease]]d to an individual or business, who is called a [[Leasehold estate|tenant]] (also a ''lessee'' or ''renter'').  When a [[juristic person]] is in this position, the term landlord is used. Other terms include '''lessor''' and '''owner'''. The term '''landlady''' may be used for [[female]] owners, and lessor applies to both genders.  The term 'landlord' historically derives from the economic system of [[feudalism]], a system of [[slavery|bonded labor.]]  Many municipalities and state governments have now legislated significant codes of tenants' rights to protect tenants against unethical business practices.<ref>http:\/\/www.oag.state.ny.us\/sites\/default\/files\/pdfs\/publications\/Tenant_Rights_2011.pdf<\/ref><ref>http:\/\/www.dca.ca.gov\/publications\/landlordbook\/catenant.pdf<\/ref>\n\n==History==\nThe concept of a landlord may be traced back to the [[feudalism|feudal]] system of [[manoralism]] ([[seignorialism]]), where a [[landed estate]] is owned by a [[Lord of the Manor]] ([[mesne lord]]s), usually members of the lower nobility which came to form the rank of [[knight]]s in the high medieval period, holding their fief via [[subinfeudation]], but in some cases the land may also be directly subject to a member of higher nobility, as in the [[royal domain]] directly owned by a king, or in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] [[Imperial Village|imperial villages]] directly subject to the emperor.\nThe medieval system ultimately continues the system of [[Roman villa|villas]] and [[latifundium|latifundia]] of the [[Roman Empire]].<ref>[http:\/\/faculty.history.wisc.edu\/sommerville\/123\/feudalism.htm Faculty.history.wisc.edu]<\/ref> Unlike feudal [[lord| lords]], contemporary landlords are not 'lords' in any meaningful sense.\n\nSeveral extremely influential [[economic philosophy| economic philosophers]] of seemingly quite divergent viewpoints have written a great deal about landlords. For example, [[Karl Marx]], the famed theorist of [[Communism]], described landlords as part of the \"[[Petite bourgeoisie]]\" and that \"the landlord exploits everything from which society benefits.\" in the ''[[Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844]]''. On the other side of the [[Political Philosophy|Political Philosophical]] spectrum, [[Adam Smith]], perhaps the greatest theorist of [[Capitalism]] to ever write, largely concurred with Marx's negative opinion of landlords, writing that  \"Landlords\u2019 right has its origin in robbery.\" (Say, t. 1, p. 136, footnote.)  Smith also stated that: \"The landlords, like all other men, love to reap where they never sowed, and demand a rent even for the natural produce of the earth. (Adam Smith, op. cit., Vol. I, p. 44.)\" Even more harshly, Smith concluded that \u201cThe rent of land, it may be thought, is frequently no more than a reasonable profit or interest for the stock laid out by the landlord upon its improvement. This, no doubt, may be partly the case upon some occasions.... The landlord demands\u201d (1) \u201ca rent even for unimproved land, and the supposed interest or profit upon the expense of improvement is generally an addition to this original rent.\u201d (2) \u201cThose improvements, besides, are not always made by the stock of the landlord, but sometimes by that of the tenant. When the lease comes to be renewed, however, the landlord commonly demands the same augmentation of rent as if they had been all made by his own.\u201d (3) \u201cHe sometimes demands rent for what is altogether incapable of human improvement.\u201d (Adam Smith, op. cit., Vol. I, p. 131) Smith's critiques of the benefit to society from landlords thus played a key role in Marx's economic, political, and philosophical theories. <ref> https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/marx\/works\/1844\/manuscripts\/rent.htm<\/ref>\n\n==Owner and tenant==\nA [[rental agreement]], or ''lease'', is the [[contract]] defining such terms as the price paid, penalties for late payments, the length of the rental or lease, and the amount of notice required before either the homeowner or tenant cancels the agreement.

Anping, Hebei.jpg|thumb|280px|Powerful landlord in chariot. [[Eastern Han]] 25-220 CE. [[Hebei]], China.]]\nA '''landlord''' is the owner of a [[house]], [[apartment]], [[condominium]], land or [[real estate]] which is [[Renting|rent]]ed or [[lease]]d to an individual or business, who is called a [[Leasehold estate|tenant]] (also a ''lessee'' or ''renter'').  When a [[juristic person]] is in this position, the term landlord is used. Other terms include '''lessor''' and '''owner'''. The term '''landlady''' may be used for [[female]] owners, and lessor applies to both genders.  \n\n==History==\nThe concept of a landlord may be traced back to the [[feudalism|feudal]] system of [[manoralism]] ([[seignorialism]]), where a [[landed estate]] is owned by a [[Lord of the Manor]] ([[mesne lord]]s), usually members of the lower nobility which came to form the rank of [[knight]]s in the high medieval period, holding their fief via [[subinfeudation]], but in some cases the land may also be directly subject to a member of higher nobility, as in the [[royal domain]] directly owned by a king, or in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] [[Imperial Village|imperial villages]] directly subject to the emperor.\nThe medieval system ultimately continues the system of [[Roman villa|villas]] and [[latifundium|latifundia]] of the [[Roman Empire]].<ref>[http:\/\/faculty.history.wisc.edu\/sommerville\/123\/feudalism.htm Faculty.history.wisc.edu]<\/ref>\n\n==Owner and tenant==\nA [[rental agreement]], or ''lease'', is the [[contract]] defining such terms as the price paid, penalties for late payments, the length of the rental or lease, and the amount of notice required before either the homeowner or tenant cancels the agreement.  In general, responsibilities are given as follows: the homeowner is responsible for making repairs and performing property maintenance, and the tenant is responsible for keeping the property clean and safe.\n\nMany owners hire a [[property management]] company to take care of all the details of renting their property out to a tenant. This usually includes advertising the property and showing it to prospective tenants, negotiating and preparing the written leases, and then, once rented, collecting rent from the tenant and performing repairs as needed.\n\n[[Image:E9438-David-Berry-monument.jpg|thumb|Being a good landlord, [[David Berry (landowner)|David Berry]] (who had owned much of what is now known as [[Berry, New South Wales|Berry - the town was named after him]]) is well remembered by his tenants.]]\n\nIn the [[United States]], homeowner\u2013tenant disputes are primarily governed by [[state law]] (not [[federal law]]) regarding [[property]] and [[contracts]].  State law and, in some places, city law or county law, sets the requirements for [[eviction]] of a tenant.  Generally, there are a limited number of reasons for which a landlord or landlady can evict his or her tenant before the expiration of the tenancy, though at the end of the lease term the rental relationship can generally be terminated without giving any reason. Some cities, counties, and States have laws establishing the maximum rent a landlord can charge, known as [[rent control]], and related [[eviction]]. There is also an [[Implied warranty of habitability#Habitability|implied warranty of habitability]], whereby a landlord must maintain safe, decent and habitable housing, meeting minimum safety requirements such as smoke detectors and a locking door.\n\n==Rental investment==\nNet income received, or losses suffered, by an investor from [[renting]] of one or two properties is subject to [[Idiosyncrasy#Idiosyncrasy in economics|idiosyncratic risk]] due to the numerous things that can happen to real property and variable behavior of tenants.<ref name=NYT032913>{{cite news|title=Rental Investment May Seem Safer Than It Really Is|url=http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2013\/03\/30\/your-money\/investing-in-a-rental-home-isnt-as-safe-as-it-may-seem.html|accessdate=March 30, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 29, 2013|author=Tara Siegel Barnard}}<\/ref>\n\nRental properties can either be paid for monthly or annually depending on the agreement between the landlord and the tenant and is always included in the lease agreement and this is one of the factors that a tenant considers before moving in.\n\n==Licensed victualler==\n{{Main|Pub}}\n\nIn the [[United Kingdom]], the owner and\/or manager of a pub, or public house, is usually called the \"landlord\/landlady\", and often, strictly incorrectly, \"[[publican]]\", the latter properly the appellation of a Roman public contractor or [[Tax farming|tax farmer]]. In a more formal situations, the term used is '''licensed victualler''' or simply \"licensee\".<ref name='Dictionary.com'>{{cite web|url=http:\/\/dictionary.reference.com\/browse\/victualler |title= Dictionary.com |accessdate=2008-07-19 }}<\/ref> A female landlord can either be called a ''landlady'' or simply landlord.\n\nThe [[Licensed Trade Charity]], formed in 2004 from the merger of the Society of Licensed Victuallers and Licensed Victualler's National Homes,<ref>{{EW charity|230011|Society of Licensed Victuallers}}<\/ref> exists to serve the retirement needs of Britain's pub landlords. The charity also runs three private schools in [[Ascot, Berkshire|Ascot]] and [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]] in [[Berkshire]] and [[Sayers Common]] in [[Sussex]]. As well as having normal full fee paying students, [[Licensed Victuallers' School]] in Ascot provides discounted education prices for the children of landlords and others in the catering industry.\n\n==Landlord policing responsibilities==\n\nIn some American cities, city government working with neighborhood activists has blamed landlords for crime, especially in the inner city. Punishment comes in the form of revoked rental licenses when city inspectors have identified a certain number of criminal incidents associated with buildings.  Some landlords, especially in [[Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul]], have successfully organized against this type of politics.<ref>[http:\/\/www.landlordpolitics.com Landorpolitics.com]<\/ref>\n\n==References==\n{{wiktionary|landlord}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Real estate}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n[[Category:Real estate]]\n[[Category:Real property law]]",

[[Hebei]], China.]]\nA '''landlord''' is the owner of a [[house]], [[apartment]], [[condominium]], land or [[real estate]] which is [[Renting|rent]]ed or [[lease]]d to an individual or business, who is called a [[Leasehold estate|tenant]] (also a ''lessee'' or ''renter'').  When a [[juristic person]] is in this position, the term landlord is used. Other terms include '''lessor''' and '''owner'''. The term '''landlady''' may be used for [[female]] owners, and lessor applies to both genders.  The term 'landlord' historically derives from the economic system of [[feudalism]], a system of [[slavery|bonded labor.]]  Many municipalities and state governments have now legislated significant codes of tenants' rights to protect tenants against unethical business practices.<ref>http:\/\/www.oag.state.ny.us\/sites\/default\/files\/pdfs\/publications\/Tenant_Rights_2011.pdf<\/ref><ref>http:\/\/www.dca.ca.gov\/publications\/landlordbook\/catenant.pdf<\/ref>\n\n==History==\nThe concept of a landlord may be traced back to the [[feudalism|feudal]] system of [[manoralism]] ([[seignorialism]]), where a [[landed estate]] is owned by a [[Lord of the Manor]] ([[mesne lord]]s), usually members of the lower nobility which came to form the rank of [[knight]]s in the high medieval period, holding their fief via [[subinfeudation]], but in some cases the land may also be directly subject to a member of higher nobility, as in the [[royal domain]] directly owned by a king, or in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] [[Imperial Village|imperial villages]] directly subject to the emperor.\nThe medieval system ultimately continues the system of [[Roman villa|villas]] and [[latifundium|latifundia]] of the [[Roman Empire]].<ref>[http:\/\/faculty.history.wisc.edu\/sommerville\/123\/feudalism.htm Faculty.history.wisc.edu]<\/ref> Unlike feudal [[lord| lords]], contemporary landlords are not 'lords' in any meaningful sense.\n\nSeveral extremely influential [[economic philosophy| economic philosophers]] of seemingly quite divergent viewpoints have written a great deal about landlords. For example, [[Karl Marx]], the famed theorist of [[Communism]], described landlords as part of the \"[[Petite bourgeoisie]]\" and that \"the landlord exploits everything from which society benefits.\" in the ''[[Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844]]''. On the other side of the [[Political Philosophy|Political Philosophical]] spectrum, [[Adam Smith]], perhaps the greatest theorist of [[Capitalism]] to ever write, largely concurred with Marx's negative opinion of landlords, writing that  \"Landlords\u2019 right has its origin in robbery.\" (Say, t. 1, p. 136, footnote.)  Smith also stated that: \"The landlords, like all other men, love to reap where they never sowed, and demand a rent even for the natural produce of the earth. (Adam Smith, op. cit., Vol. I, p. 44.)\" Even more harshly, Smith concluded that \u201cThe rent of land, it may be thought, is frequently no more than a reasonable profit or interest for the stock laid out by the landlord upon its improvement. This, no doubt, may be partly the case upon some occasions.... The landlord demands\u201d (1) \u201ca rent even for unimproved land, and the supposed interest or profit upon the expense of improvement is generally an addition to this original rent.\u201d (2) \u201cThose improvements, besides, are not always made by the stock of the landlord, but sometimes by that of the tenant. When the lease comes to be renewed, however, the landlord commonly demands the same augmentation of rent as if they had been all made by his own.\u201d (3) \u201cHe sometimes demands rent for what is altogether incapable of human improvement.\u201d (Adam Smith, op. cit., Vol. I, p. 131) Smith's critiques of the benefit to society from landlords thus played a key role in Marx's economic, political, and philosophical theories. <ref> https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/marx\/works\/1844\/manuscripts\/rent.htm<\/ref>\n\n==Owner and tenant==\nA [[rental agreement]], or ''lease'', is the [[contract]] defining such terms as the price paid, penalties for late payments, the length of the rental or lease, and the amount of notice required before either the homeowner or tenant cancels the agreement.  In general, responsibilities are given as follows: the homeowner is responsible for making repairs and performing property maintenance, and the tenant is responsible for keeping the property clean and safe.\n\nMany owners hire a [[property management]] company to take care of all the details of renting their property out to a tenant. This usually includes advertising the property and showing it to prospective tenants, negotiating and preparing the written leases, and then, once rented, collecting rent from the tenant and performing repairs as needed.\n\n[[Image:E9438-David-Berry-monument.jpg|thumb|Being a good landlord, [[David Berry (landowner)|David Berry]] (who had owned much of what is now known as [[Berry, New South Wales|Berry - the town was named after him]]) is well remembered by his tenants.]]\n\nIn the [[United States]], homeowner\u2013tenant disputes are primarily governed by [[state law]] (not [[federal law]]) regarding [[property]] and [[contracts]].  State law and, in some places, city law or county law, sets the requirements for [[eviction]] of a tenant.  Generally, there are a limited number of reasons for which a landlord or landlady can evict his or her tenant before the expiration of the tenancy, though at the end of the lease term the rental relationship can generally be terminated without giving any reason. Some cities, counties, and States have laws establishing the maximum rent a landlord can charge, known as [[rent control]], and related [[eviction]].

The term 'landlord' historically derives from the economic system of [[feudalism]], a system of [[slavery|bonded labor.]] <ref>http:\/\/faculty.history.wisc.edu\/sommerville\/123\/feudalism.htm<\/ref> Most municipalities and state governments have now legislated significant codes of tenants' rights to protect tenants against unethical business practices. <ref>http:\/\/portal.hud.gov\/hudportal\/HUD?src=\/topics\/rental_assistance\/tenantrights<\/ref><ref>http:\/\/www.oag.state.ny.us\/sites\/default\/files\/pdfs\/publications\/Tenant_Rights_2011.pdf<\/ref><ref>http:\/\/www.dca.ca.gov\/publications\/landlordbook\/catenant.pdf<\/ref>\n\n==History==\nThe concept of a landlord may be traced back to the [[feudalism|feudal]] system of [[manoralism]] ([[seignorialism]]), where a [[landed estate]] is owned by a [[Lord of the Manor]] ([[mesne lord]]s), usually members of the lower nobility which came to form the rank of [[knight]]s in the high medieval period, holding their fief via [[subinfeudation]], but in some cases the land may also be directly subject to a member of higher nobility, as in the [[royal domain]] directly owned by a king, or in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] [[Imperial Village|imperial villages]] directly subject to the emperor.\nThe medieval system ultimately continues the system of [[Roman villa|villas]] and [[latifundium|latifundia]] of the [[Roman Empire]].<ref>[http:\/\/faculty.history.wisc.edu\/sommerville\/123\/feudalism.htm Faculty.history.wisc.edu]<\/ref> Unlike feudal [[lord| lords]], contemporary landlords are not 'lords' in any meaningful sense.\n\nSeveral extremely influential [[economic philosophy| economic philosophers]] of seemingly quite divergent viewpoints have written a great deal about landlords. For example, [[Karl Marx]], the famed theorist of [[Communism]], described landlords as part of the \"[[Petite bourgeoisie]]\" and that \"the landlord exploits everything from which society benefits.\" in the ''[[Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844]]''. On the other side of the [[Political Philosophy|Political Philosophical]] spectrum, [[Adam Smith]], perhaps the greatest theorist of [[Capitalism]] to ever write, largely concurred with Marx's negative opinion of landlords, writing that  \"Landlords\u2019 right has its origin in robbery.\" (Say, t. 1, p. 136, footnote.)  Smith also stated that: \"The landlords, like all other men, love to reap where they never sowed, and demand a rent even for the natural produce of the earth. (Adam Smith, op. cit., Vol. I, p. 44.)\" Even more harshly, Smith concluded that \u201cThe rent of land, it may be thought, is frequently no more than a reasonable profit or interest for the stock laid out by the landlord upon its improvement. This, no doubt, may be partly the case upon some occasions.... The landlord demands\u201d (1) \u201ca rent even for unimproved land, and the supposed interest or profit upon the expense of improvement is generally an addition to this original rent.\u201d (2) \u201cThose improvements, besides, are not always made by the stock of the landlord, but sometimes by that of the tenant. When the lease comes to be renewed, however, the landlord commonly demands the same augmentation of rent as if they had been all made by his own.\u201d (3) \u201cHe sometimes demands rent for what is altogether incapable of human improvement.\u201d (Adam Smith, op. cit., Vol. I, p. 131) Smith's critiques of the benefit to society from landlords thus played a key role in Marx's economic, political, and philosophical theories. <ref> https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/marx\/works\/1844\/manuscripts\/rent.htm<\/ref>\n\n==Owner and tenant==\nA [[rental agreement]], or ''lease'', is the [[contract]] defining such terms as the price paid, penalties for late payments, the length of the rental or lease, and the amount of notice required before either the homeowner or tenant cancels the agreement.  In general, responsibilities are given as follows: the homeowner is responsible for making repairs and performing property maintenance, and the tenant is responsible for keeping the property clean and safe.\n\nMany owners hire a [[property management]] company to take care of all the details of renting their property out to a tenant. This usually includes advertising the property and showing it to prospective tenants, negotiating and preparing the written leases, and then, once rented, collecting rent from the tenant and performing repairs as needed.\n\n[[Image:E9438-David-Berry-monument.jpg|thumb|Being a good landlord, [[David Berry (landowner)|David Berry]] (who had owned much of what is now known as [[Berry, New South Wales|Berry - the town was named after him]]) is well remembered by his tenants.]]\n\nIn the [[United States]], homeowner\u2013tenant disputes are primarily governed by [[state law]] (not [[federal law]]) regarding [[property]] and [[contracts]].  State law and, in some places, city law or county law, sets the requirements for [[eviction]] of a tenant.  Generally, there are a limited number of reasons for which a landlord or landlady can evict his or her tenant before the expiration of the tenancy, though at the end of the lease term the rental relationship can generally be terminated without giving any reason. Some cities, counties, and States have laws establishing the maximum rent a landlord can charge, known as [[rent control]], and related [[eviction]]. There is also an [[Implied warranty of habitability#Habitability|implied warranty of habitability]], whereby a landlord must maintain safe, decent and habitable housing, meeting minimum safety requirements such as smoke detectors and a locking door.\n\n==Rental investment==\nNet income received, or losses suffered, by an investor from [[renting]] of one or two properties is subject to [[Idiosyncrasy#Idiosyncrasy in economics|idiosyncratic risk]] due to the numerous things that can happen to real property and variable behavior of tenants.<ref name=NYT032913>{{cite news|title=Rental Investment May Seem Safer Than It Really Is|url=http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2013\/03\/30\/your-money\/investing-in-a-rental-home-isnt-as-safe-as-it-may-seem.html|accessdate=March 30, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 29, 2013|author=Tara Siegel Barnard}}<\/ref>\n\nRental properties can either be paid for monthly or annually depending on the agreement between the landlord and the tenant and is always included in the lease agreement and this is one of the factors that a tenant considers before moving in.\n\n==Licensed victualler==\n{{Main|Pub}}\n\nIn the [[United Kingdom]], the owner and\/or manager of a pub, or public house, is usually called the \"landlord\/landlady\", and often, strictly incorrectly, \"[[publican]]\", the latter properly the appellation of a Roman public contractor or [[Tax farming|tax farmer]]. In a more formal situations, the term used is '''licensed victualler''' or simply \"licensee\".<ref name='Dictionary.com'>{{cite web|url=http:\/\/dictionary.reference.com\/browse\/victualler |title= Dictionary.com |accessdate=2008-07-19 }}<\/ref> A female landlord can either be called a ''landlady'' or simply landlord.\n\nThe [[Licensed Trade Charity]], formed in 2004 from the merger of the Society of Licensed Victuallers and Licensed Victualler's National Homes,<ref>{{EW charity|230011|Society of Licensed Victuallers}}<\/ref> exists to serve the retirement needs of Britain's pub landlords. The charity also runs three private schools in [[Ascot, Berkshire|Ascot]] and [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]] in [[Berkshire]] and [[Sayers Common]] in [[Sussex]]. As well as having normal full fee paying students, [[Licensed Victuallers' School]] in Ascot provides discounted education prices for the children of landlords and others in the catering industry.\n\n==Landlord policing responsibilities==\n\nIn some American cities, city government working with neighborhood activists has blamed landlords for crime, especially in the inner city. Punishment comes in the form of revoked rental licenses when city inspectors have identified a certain number of criminal incidents associated with buildings.  Some landlords, especially in [[Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul]], have successfully organized against this type of politics.<ref>[http:\/\/www.landlordpolitics.com Landorpolitics.com]<\/ref>\n\n==References==\n{{wiktionary|landlord}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Real estate}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n[[Category:Real estate]]\n[[Category:Real property law]]",

Anping, Hebei.jpg|thumb|280px|Powerful landlord in chariot. [[Eastern Han]] 25-220 CE. [[Hebei]], China.]]\nA '''landlord''' is the owner of a [[house]], [[apartment]], [[condominium]], land or [[real estate]] which is [[Renting|rent]]ed or [[lease]]d to an individual or business, who is called a [[Leasehold estate|tenant]] (also a ''lessee'' or ''renter'').  When a [[juristic person]] is in this position, the term landlord is used. Other terms include '''lessor''' and '''owner'''. The term '''landlady''' may be used for [[female]] owners, and lessor applies to both genders.  \n\n==History==\nThe concept of a landlord may be traced back to the [[feudalism|feudal]] system of [[manoralism]] ([[seignorialism]]), where a [[landed estate]] is owned by a [[Lord of the Manor]] ([[mesne lord]]s), usually members of the lower nobility which came to form the rank of [[knight]]s in the high medieval period, holding their fief via [[subinfeudation]], but in some cases the land may also be directly subject to a member of higher nobility, as in the [[royal domain]] directly owned by a king, or in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] [[Imperial Village|imperial villages]] directly subject to the emperor.\nThe medieval system ultimately continues the system of [[Roman villa|villas]] and [[latifundium|latifundia]] of the [[Roman Empire]].<ref>[http:\/\/faculty.history.wisc.edu\/sommerville\/123\/feudalism.htm Faculty.history.wisc.edu]<\/ref>\n\n==Owner and tenant==\nA [[rental agreement]], or ''lease'', is the [[contract]] defining such terms as the price paid, penalties for late payments, the length of the rental or lease, and the amount of notice required before either the homeowner or tenant cancels the agreement.  In general, responsibilities are given as follows: the homeowner is responsible for making repairs and performing property maintenance, and the tenant is responsible for keeping the property clean and safe.\n\nMany owners hire a [[property management]] company to take care of all the details of renting their property out to a tenant. This usually includes advertising the property and showing it to prospective tenants, negotiating and preparing the written leases, and then, once rented, collecting rent from the tenant and performing repairs as needed.\n\n[[Image:E9438-David-Berry-monument.jpg|thumb|Being a good landlord, [[David Berry (landowner)|David Berry]] (who had owned much of what is now known as [[Berry, New South Wales|Berry - the town was named after him]]) is well remembered by his tenants.]]\n\nIn the [[United States]], homeowner\u2013tenant disputes are primarily governed by [[state law]] (not [[federal law]]) regarding [[property]] and [[contracts]].  State law and, in some places, city law or county law, sets the requirements for [[eviction]] of a tenant.  Generally, there are a limited number of reasons for which a landlord or landlady can evict his or her tenant before the expiration of the tenancy, though at the end of the lease term the rental relationship can generally be terminated without giving any reason. Some cities, counties, and States have laws establishing the maximum rent a landlord can charge, known as [[rent control]], and related [[eviction]]. There is also an [[Implied warranty of habitability#Habitability|implied warranty of habitability]], whereby a landlord must maintain safe, decent and habitable housing, meeting minimum safety requirements such as smoke detectors and a locking door.\n\n==Rental investment==\nNet income received, or losses suffered, by an investor from [[renting]] of one or two properties is subject to [[Idiosyncrasy#Idiosyncrasy in economics|idiosyncratic risk]] due to the numerous things that can happen to real property and variable behavior of tenants.<ref name=NYT032913>{{cite news|title=Rental Investment May Seem Safer Than It Really Is|url=http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2013\/03\/30\/your-money\/investing-in-a-rental-home-isnt-as-safe-as-it-may-seem.html|accessdate=March 30, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 29, 2013|author=Tara Siegel Barnard}}<\/ref>\n\nRental properties can either be paid for monthly or annually depending on the agreement between the landlord and the tenant and is always included in the lease agreement and this is one of the factors that a tenant considers before moving in.\n\n==Licensed victualler==\n{{Main|Pub}}\n\nIn the [[United Kingdom]], the owner and\/or manager of a pub, or public house, is usually called the \"landlord\/landlady\", and often, strictly incorrectly, \"[[publican]]\", the latter properly the appellation of a Roman public contractor or [[Tax farming|tax farmer]].

The term '''landlady''' may be used for [[female]] owners, and lessor applies to both genders.  \n\n==History==\nThe concept of a landlord may be traced back to the [[feudalism|feudal]] system of [[manoralism]] ([[seignorialism]]), where a [[landed estate]] is owned by a [[Lord of the Manor]] ([[mesne lord]]s), usually members of the lower nobility which came to form the rank of [[knight]]s in the high medieval period, holding their fief via [[subinfeudation]], but in some cases the land may also be directly subject to a member of higher nobility, as in the [[royal domain]] directly owned by a king, or in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] [[Imperial Village|imperial villages]] directly subject to the emperor.\nThe medieval system ultimately continues the system of [[Roman villa|villas]] and [[latifundium|latifundia]] of the [[Roman Empire]].<ref>[http:\/\/faculty.history.wisc.edu\/sommerville\/123\/feudalism.htm Faculty.history.wisc.edu]<\/ref>\n\n==Owner and tenant==\nA [[rental agreement]], or ''lease'', is the [[contract]] defining such terms as the price paid, penalties for late payments, the length of the rental or lease, and the amount of notice required before either the homeowner or tenant cancels the agreement.

This usually includes advertising the property and showing it to prospective tenants, negotiating and preparing the written leases, and then, once rented, collecting rent from the tenant and performing repairs as needed.\n\n[[Image:E9438-David-Berry-monument.jpg|thumb|Being a good landlord, [[David Berry (landowner)|David Berry]] (who had owned much of what is now known as [[Berry, New South Wales|Berry - the town was named after him]]) is well remembered by his tenants.]]\n\nIn the [[United States]], homeowner\u2013tenant disputes are primarily governed by [[state law]] (not [[federal law]]) regarding [[property]] and [[contracts]].

Anping, Hebei.jpg|thumb|280px|Powerful landlord in chariot. [[Eastern Han]] 25-220 CE. [[Hebei]], China.]]\nA '''landlord''' is the owner of a [[house]], [[apartment]], [[condominium]], land or [[real estate]] which is [[Renting|rent]]ed or [[lease]]d to an individual or business, who is called a [[Leasehold estate|tenant]] (also a ''lessee'' or ''renter'').  When a [[juristic person]] is in this position, the term landlord is used. Other terms include '''lessor''' and '''owner'''. The term '''landlady''' may be used for [[female]] owners, and lessor applies to both genders.  \n\n==History==\nThe concept of a landlord may be traced back to the [[feudalism|feudal]] system of [[manoralism]] ([[seignorialism]]), where a [[landed estate]] is owned by a [[Lord of the Manor]] ([[mesne lord]]s), usually members of the lower nobility which came to form the rank of [[knight]]s in the high medieval period, holding their fief via [[subinfeudation]], but in some cases the land may also be directly subject to a member of higher nobility, as in the [[royal domain]] directly owned by a king, or in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] [[Imperial Village|imperial villages]] directly subject to the emperor.\nThe medieval system ultimately continues the system of [[Roman villa|villas]] and [[latifundium|latifundia]] of the [[Roman Empire]].<ref>[http:\/\/faculty.history.wisc.edu\/sommerville\/123\/feudalism.htm Faculty.history.wisc.edu]<\/ref>\n\nIn modern times, landlords provide housing for persons who cannot afford to own their own homes.  This can be both a lucrative and challenging occupation.  Because the public sometimes considers renters to be a less desirable resident of a neighborhood than homeowners, a certain stigma has come to attach to the owners of rental property, especially in troubled neighborhoods.  The term \"slumlord\" is sometimes used to describe landlords in those circumstances.  In Minneapolis, such landlords rose up against city officials and, in the 2001 election, succeeded in defeating the incumbent mayor and half the city council.  But such situations are quite unusual.\n\n==Owner and tenant==\nA [[rental agreement]], or ''lease'', is the [[contract]] defining such terms as the price paid, penalties for late payments, the length of the rental or lease, and the amount of notice required before either the homeowner or tenant cancels the agreement.  In general, responsibilities are given as follows: the homeowner is responsible for making repairs and performing property maintenance, and the tenant is responsible for keeping the property clean and safe.\n\nMany owners hire a [[property management]] company to take care of all the details of renting their property out to a tenant. This usually includes advertising the property and showing it to prospective tenants, negotiating and preparing the written leases, and then, once rented, collecting rent from the tenant and performing repairs as needed.\n\n[[Image:E9438-David-Berry-monument.jpg|thumb|Being a good landlord, [[David Berry (landowner)|David Berry]] (who had owned much of what is now known as [[Berry, New South Wales|Berry - the town was named after him]]) is well remembered by his tenants.]]\n\nIn the [[United States]], homeowner\u2013tenant disputes are primarily governed by [[state law]] (not [[federal law]]) regarding [[property]] and [[contracts]].  State law and, in some places, city law or county law, sets the requirements for [[eviction]] of a tenant.  Generally, there are a limited number of reasons for which a landlord or landlady can evict his or her tenant before the expiration of the tenancy, though at the end of the lease term the rental relationship can generally be terminated without giving any reason. Some cities, counties, and States have laws establishing the maximum rent a landlord can charge, known as [[rent control]], and related [[eviction]]. There is also an [[Implied warranty of habitability#Habitability|implied warranty of habitability]], whereby a landlord must maintain safe, decent and habitable housing, meeting minimum safety requirements such as smoke detectors and a locking door.\n\n==Rental investment==\nNet income received, or losses suffered, by an investor from [[renting]] of one or two properties is subject to [[Idiosyncrasy#Idiosyncrasy in economics|idiosyncratic risk]] due to the numerous things that can happen to real property and variable behavior of tenants.<ref name=NYT032913>{{cite news|title=Rental Investment May Seem Safer Than It Really Is|url=http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2013\/03\/30\/your-money\/investing-in-a-rental-home-isnt-as-safe-as-it-may-seem.html|accessdate=March 30, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 29, 2013|author=Tara Siegel Barnard}}<\/ref>\n\nRental properties can either be paid for monthly or annually depending on the agreement between the landlord and the tenant and is always included in the lease agreement and this is one of the factors that a tenant considers before moving in.

Anping, Hebei.jpg|thumb|280px|Powerful landlord in chariot. [[Eastern Han]] 25-220 CE. [[Hebei]], China.]]\nA '''landlord''' is the owner of a [[house]], [[apartment]], [[condominium]], land or [[real estate]] which is [[Renting|rent]]ed or [[lease]]d to an individual or business, who is called a [[Leasehold estate|tenant]] (also a ''lessee'' or ''renter'').  When a [[juristic person]] is in this position, the term landlord is used. Other terms include '''lessor''' and '''owner'''. The term '''landlady''' may be used for [[female]] owners, and lessor applies to both genders.  \n\n==History==\nThe concept of a landlord may be traced back to the [[feudalism|feudal]] system of [[manoralism]] ([[seignorialism]]), where a [[landed estate]] is owned by a [[Lord of the Manor]] ([[mesne lord]]s), usually members of the lower nobility which came to form the rank of [[knight]]s in the high medieval period, holding their fief via [[subinfeudation]], but in some cases the land may also be directly subject to a member of higher nobility, as in the [[royal domain]] directly owned by a king, or in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] [[Imperial Village|imperial villages]] directly subject to the emperor.\nThe medieval system ultimately continues the system of [[Roman villa|villas]] and [[latifundium|latifundia]] of the [[Roman Empire]].<ref>[http:\/\/faculty.history.wisc.edu\/sommerville\/123\/feudalism.htm Faculty.history.wisc.edu]<\/ref>\n\n==Owner and tenant==\nA [[rental agreement]], or ''lease'', is the [[contract]] defining such terms as the price paid, penalties for late payments, the length of the rental or lease, and the amount of notice required before either the homeowner or tenant cancels the agreement.  In general, responsibilities are given as follows: the homeowner is responsible for making repairs and performing property maintenance, and the tenant is responsible for keeping the property clean and safe.\n\nMany owners hire a [[property management]] company to take care of all the details of renting their property out to a tenant. This usually includes advertising the property and showing it to prospective tenants, negotiating and preparing the written leases, and then, once rented, collecting rent from the tenant and performing repairs as needed.\n\n[[Image:E9438-David-Berry-monument.jpg|thumb|Being a good landlord, [[David Berry (landowner)|David Berry]] (who had owned much of what is now known as [[Berry, New South Wales|Berry - the town was named after him]]) is well remembered by his tenants.]]\n\nIn the [[United States]], homeowner\u2013tenant disputes are primarily governed by [[state law]] (not [[federal law]]) regarding [[property]] and [[contracts]].  State law and, in some places, city law or county law, sets the requirements for [[eviction]] of a tenant.  Generally, there are a limited number of reasons for which a landlord or landlady can evict his or her tenant before the expiration of the tenancy, though at the end of the lease term the rental relationship can generally be terminated without giving any reason. Some cities, counties, and States have laws establishing the maximum rent a landlord can charge, known as [[rent control]], and related [[eviction]]. There is also an [[Implied warranty of habitability#Habitability|implied warranty of habitability]], whereby a landlord must maintain safe, decent and habitable housing, meeting minimum safety requirements such as smoke detectors and a locking door.\n\n==Rental investment==\nNet income received, or losses suffered, by an investor from [[renting]] of one or two properties is subject to [[Idiosyncrasy#Idiosyncrasy in economics|idiosyncratic risk]] due to the numerous things that can happen to real property and variable behavior of tenants.<ref name=NYT032913>{{cite news|title=Rental Investment May Seem Safer Than It Really Is|url=http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2013\/03\/30\/your-money\/investing-in-a-rental-home-isnt-as-safe-as-it-may-seem.html|accessdate=March 30, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 29, 2013|author=Tara Siegel Barnard}}<\/ref>\n\nRental properties can either be paid for monthly or annually depending on the agreement between the landlord and the tenant and is always included in the lease agreement and this is one of the factors that a tenant considers before moving in.  A landlord can also decide to collect a security deposit or move-in fee which can also be a consideration for the tenant.  Many factors including city\/state regulations can drive the landlord to choose one over the other.\n\n==Licensed victualler==\n{{Main|Pub}}\n\nIn the [[United Kingdom]], the owner and\/or manager of a pub, or public house, is usually called the \"landlord\/landlady\", and often, strictly incorrectly, \"[[publican]]\", the latter properly the appellation of a Roman public contractor or [[Tax farming|tax farmer]]. In a more formal situations, the term used is '''licensed victualler''' or simply \"licensee\".<ref name='Dictionary.com'>{{cite web|url=http:\/\/dictionary.reference.com\/browse\/victualler |title= Dictionary.com |accessdate=2008-07-19 }}<\/ref> A female landlord can either be called a ''landlady'' or simply landlord.\n\nThe [[Licensed Trade Charity]], formed in 2004 from the merger of the Society of Licensed Victuallers and Licensed Victualler's National Homes,<ref>{{EW charity|230011|Society of Licensed Victuallers}}<\/ref> exists to serve the retirement needs of Britain's pub landlords. The charity also runs three private schools in [[Ascot, Berkshire|Ascot]] and [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]] in [[Berkshire]] and [[Sayers Common]] in [[Sussex]]. As well as having normal full fee paying students, [[Licensed Victuallers' School]] in Ascot provides discounted education prices for the children of landlords and others in the catering industry.\n\n==References==\n{{wiktionary|landlord}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Real estate}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n[[Category:Real estate]]\n[[Category:Real property law]]",

The term '''landlady''' may be used for [[female]] owners, and lessor applies to both genders.  \n\n==History==\nThe concept of a landlord may be traced back to the [[feudalism|feudal]] system of [[manoralism]] ([[seignorialism]]), where a [[landed estate]] is owned by a [[Lord of the Manor]] ([[mesne lord]]s), usually members of the lower nobility which came to form the rank of [[knight]]s in the high medieval period, holding their fief via [[subinfeudation]], but in some cases the land may also be directly subject to a member of higher nobility, as in the [[royal domain]] directly owned by a king, or in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] [[Imperial Village|imperial villages]] directly subject to the emperor.\nThe medieval system ultimately continues the system of [[Roman villa|villas]] and [[latifundium|latifundia]] of the [[Roman Empire]].<ref>[http:\/\/faculty.history.wisc.edu\/sommerville\/123\/feudalism.htm Faculty.history.wisc.edu]<\/ref>\n\n==Owner and tenant==\nA [[rental agreement]], or ''lease'', is the [[contract]] defining such terms as the price paid, penalties for late payments, the length of the rental or lease, and the amount of notice required before either the homeowner or tenant cancels the agreement.

The term '''landlady''' may be used for [[women]] owners, and lessor applies to both genders.\n\n==History==\nThe concept of a landlord may be traced back to the [[feudalism|feudal]] system of [[manoralism]] ([[seignorialism]]), where a [[landed estate]] is owned by a [[Lord of the Manor]] ([[mesne lord]]s), usually members of the lower nobility which came to form the rank of [[knight]]s in the high medieval period, holding their fief via [[subinfeudation]], but in some cases the land may also be directly subject to a member of higher nobility, as in the [[royal domain]] directly owned by a king, or in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] [[Imperial Village|imperial villages]] directly subject to the emperor.\nThe medieval system ultimately continues the system of [[Roman villa|villas]] and [[latifundium|latifundia]] of the [[Roman Empire]].<ref>[http:\/\/faculty.history.wisc.edu\/sommerville\/123\/feudalism.htm Faculty.history.wisc.edu]<\/ref>\n\n==Owner and tenant==\nA [[rental agreement]], or ''lease'', is the [[contract]] defining such terms as the price paid, penalties for late payments, the length of the rental or lease, and the amount of notice required before either the homeowner or tenant cancels the agreement.

Generally, there are a limited number of reasons for which a landlord or landlady can evict his or her tenant before the expiration of the tenancy, though at the end of the lease term the rental relationship can generally be terminated without giving any reason.

[[Hebei]], China.]]\nA '''landlord''' is the owner of a [[house]], [[apartment]], [[condominium]], land or [[real estate]] which is [[Renting|rent]]ed or [[lease]]d to an individual or business, who is called a [[Leasehold estate|tenant]] (also a ''lessee'' or ''renter'').  When a [[juristic person]] is in this position, the term landlord is used. Other terms include '''lessor''' and '''owner'''. The term '''landlady''' may be used for [[women]] owners, and lessor applies to both genders.\n\n==History==\nThe concept of a landlord may be traced back to the [[feudalism|feudal]] system of [[manoralism]] ([[seignorialism]]), where a [[landed estate]] is owned by a [[Lord of the Manor]] ([[mesne lord]]s), usually members of the lower nobility which came to form the rank of [[knight]]s in the high medieval period, holding their fief via [[subinfeudation]], but in some cases the land may also be directly subject to a member of higher nobility, as in the [[royal domain]] directly owned by a king, or in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] [[Imperial Village|imperial villages]] directly subject to the emperor.\nThe medieval system ultimately continues the system of [[Roman villa|villas]] and [[latifundium|latifundia]] of the [[Roman Empire]].<ref>[http:\/\/faculty.history.wisc.edu\/sommerville\/123\/feudalism.htm Faculty.history.wisc.edu]<\/ref>\n\n==Owner and tenant==\nA [[rental agreement]], or ''lease'', is the [[contract]] defining such terms as the price paid, penalties for late payments, the length of the rental or lease, and the amount of notice required before either the homeowner or tenant cancels the agreement.  In general, responsibilities are given as follows: the homeowner is responsible for making repairs and performing property maintenance, and the tenant is responsible for keeping the property clean and safe.\n\nMany owners hire a [[property management]] company to take care of all the details of renting their property out to a tenant. This usually includes advertising the property and showing it to prospective tenants, negotiating and preparing the written leases, and then, once rented, collecting rent from the tenant and performing repairs as needed.\n\n[[Image:E9438-David-Berry-monument.jpg|thumb|Being a good landlord, [[David Berry (landowner)|David Berry]] (who had owned much of what is now known as [[Berry, New South Wales|Berry - the town was named after him]]) is well remembered by his tenants.]]\n\n===United States===\nIn the [[United States]], [[residential]] homeowner\u2013tenant disputes are primarily governed by [[state law]] (not [[federal law]]) regarding [[property]] and [[contracts]].  State law and, in some places, city law or county law, sets the requirements for [[eviction]] of a tenant.  Generally, there are a limited number of reasons for which a landlord or landlady can evict his or her tenant before the expiration of the tenancy, though at the end of the lease term the rental relationship can generally be terminated without giving any reason. Some cities, counties, and States have laws establishing the maximum rent a landlord can charge, known as rent control, or [[rent regulation]], and related [[eviction]]. There is also an [[Implied warranty of habitability#Habitability|implied warranty of habitability]], whereby a landlord must maintain safe, decent and habitable housing, meeting minimum safety requirements such as smoke detectors and a locking door.\n\n===Canada===\nIn the [[Canada]],  [[residential]] homeowner\u2013tenant disputes are primarily governed by [[provincial law]] (not [[federal law]]) regarding [[property]] and [[contracts]].  Provincial  law sets the requirements for [[eviction]] of a tenant.  Generally, there are a limited number of reasons for which a landlord  can evict a tenant. Some provinces have laws establishing the maximum rent a landlord can charge, known as rent control, or [[rent regulation]], and related [[eviction]]. There is also an [[Implied warranty of habitability#Habitability|implied warranty of habitability]], whereby a landlord must maintain safe, decent and habitable housing, meeting minimum safety requirements.\n\n==Rental investment==\nNet income received, or losses suffered, by an investor from [[renting]] of one or two properties is subject to [[Idiosyncrasy#Idiosyncrasy in economics|idiosyncratic risk]] due to the numerous things that can happen to real property and variable behavior of tenants.<ref name=NYT032913>{{cite news|title=Rental Investment May Seem Safer Than It Really Is|url=http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2013\/03\/30\/your-money\/investing-in-a-rental-home-isnt-as-safe-as-it-may-seem.html|accessdate=March 30, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 29, 2013|author=Tara Siegel Barnard}}<\/ref>\n\nRental properties can either be paid for monthly or annually depending on the agreement between the landlord and the tenant and is always included in the lease agreement and this is one of the factors that a tenant considers before moving in.  A landlord can also decide to collect a security deposit or move-in fee which can also be a consideration for the tenant.  Many factors including city\/state regulations can drive the landlord to choose one over the other.\n\n==Licensed victualler==\n{{Main article|Pub}}\n\nIn the [[United Kingdom]], the owner and\/or manager of a pub, or public house, is usually called the \"landlord\/landlady\", and often, strictly incorrectly, \"[[publican]]\", the latter properly the appellation of a Roman public contractor or [[Tax farming|tax farmer]]. In a more formal situations, the term used is '''licensed victualler''' or simply \"licensee\".<ref name='Dictionary.com'>{{cite web|url=http:\/\/dictionary.reference.com\/browse\/victualler |title= Dictionary.com |accessdate=2008-07-19 }}<\/ref> A female landlord can either be called a ''landlady'' or simply landlord.\n\nThe [[Licensed Trade Charity]], formed in 2004 from the merger of the Society of Licensed Victuallers and Licensed Victualler's National Homes,<ref>{{EW charity|230011|Society of Licensed Victuallers}}<\/ref> exists to serve the retirement needs of Britain's pub landlords. The charity also runs three private schools in [[Ascot, Berkshire|Ascot]] and [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]] in [[Berkshire]] and [[Sayers Common]] in [[Sussex]]. As well as having normal full fee paying students, [[Licensed Victuallers' School]] in Ascot provides discounted education prices for the children of landlords and others in the catering industry.\n\n==Landlord associations in Australia==\n\nThere are significant associations of  landlords in [[Australia]]. These associations\/societies provide support\nfor their  members in facing a range of issues <ref>http:\/\/www.poavic.org<\/ref>\nby providing a means of mutual support,\nand also lobby relevant authorities and parliament with regard to the details and implementation\nof residential and some commercial tenancy legislation. These associations need to be distinguished from the class of property owner associations that represent\nthe 'big end of town'   - the owners of major buildings and very large residential\nhousing complexes, such as the Property Council of Australia.<ref>http:\/\/www.propertycouncil.com.au\/<\/ref>\n\nProperty Owners Association of Australia (POAA)<ref>http:\/\/www.poaa.asn.au\/<\/ref>\n\nProperty Owners Association of Victoria (POAVIC) <ref>http:\/\/www.poavic.org<\/ref>\n\nPOAQ - Property Owners Association of Queensland <ref>http:\/\/www.poaa.asn.au\/POAQ\/index.php<\/ref>\n\nProperty Owners Association of NSW <ref>https:\/\/www.poansw.com.au\/<\/ref>\n\nProperty Owners Association of Western Australia <ref>http:\/\/www.poawa.com.au\/<\/ref>\n\nLandlords Association of South Australia <ref>http:\/\/www.landlords.org.au\/<\/ref>\n\n==References==\n{{wiktionary|landlord}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Real estate}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Real estate]]\n[[Category:Real property law]]",

    "original": "{{other uses|landlord (disambiguation)}}\n{{Redirect|Landlady|other uses|The Landlady (disambiguation){{!}}The Landlady}}\n[[File:Powerful landlord in chariot. Eastern Han 25-220 CE. Anping, Hebei.jpg|thumb|280px|Powerful landlord in chariot. [[Eastern Han]] 25-220 CE. [[Hebei]], China.]]\nA '''landlord''' is the owner of a [[house]], [[apartment]], [[condominium]], land or [[real estate]] which is [[Renting|rent]]ed or [[lease]]d to an individual or business, who is called a [[Leasehold estate|tenant]] (also a ''lessee'' or ''renter'').  When a [[juristic person]] is in this position, the term landlord is used. Other terms include '''lessor''' and '''owner'''. The term '''landlady''' may be used for [[women]] owners, and lessor applies to both genders.\n\n==History==\nThe concept of a landlord may be traced back to the [[feudalism|feudal]] system of [[manoralism]] ([[seignorialism]]), where a [[landed estate]] is owned by a [[Lord of the Manor]] ([[mesne lord]]s), usually members of the lower nobility which came to form the rank of [[knight]]s in the high medieval period, holding their fief via [[subinfeudation]], but in some cases the land may also be directly subject to a member of higher nobility, as in the [[royal domain]] directly owned by a king, or in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] [[Imperial Village|imperial villages]] directly subject to the emperor.\nThe medieval system ultimately continues the system of [[Roman villa|villas]] and [[latifundium|latifundia]] of the [[Roman Empire]].<ref>[http:\/\/faculty.history.wisc.edu\/sommerville\/123\/feudalism.htm Faculty.history.wisc.edu]<\/ref>\n\nIn modern times, landlords provide housing for persons who cannot afford or don't want to own their own homes.  This can be both a lucrative and challenging occupation.  Because the public sometimes considers renters to be a less desirable resident of a neighborhood than homeowners, a certain stigma has come to attach to the owners of rental property, especially in troubled neighborhoods.  The term \"slumlord\" is sometimes used to describe landlords in those circumstances. Often, slumlords are notorious for denying essential services, illegally locking out their tenants, stealing their tenants belongings, sabotaging or destroying their own property to drive out tenants, helping themselves to illegal evictions out of court, and sometimes, raping or murdering their tenants. These situations are by no means unusual, and most landlords consider them to be among the \"perks\" of the job.  .<ref> http:\/\/www.landlordpolitics.com\/landlord.html   Minneapolis Property Rights Action Committee events & adventures  <\/ref>\n\n==Owner and tenant==\nA [[rental agreement]], or ''lease'', is the [[contract]] defining such terms as the price paid, penalties for late payments, the length of the rental or lease, and the amount of notice required before either the homeowner or tenant cancels the agreement.  In general, responsibilities are given as follows: the homeowner is responsible for making repairs and performing property maintenance, and the tenant is responsible for keeping the property clean and safe.\n\nMany owners hire a [[property management]] company to take care of all the details of renting their property out to a tenant. This usually includes advertising the property and showing it to prospective tenants, negotiating and preparing the written leases, and then, once rented, collecting rent from the tenant and performing repairs as needed.\n\n[[Image:E9438-David-Berry-monument.jpg|thumb|Being a good landlord, [[David Berry (landowner)|David Berry]] (who had owned much of what is now known as [[Berry, New South Wales|Berry - the town was named after him]]) is well remembered by his tenants.]]\n\n===United States===\nIn the [[United States]], [[residential]] homeowner\u2013tenant disputes are primarily governed by [[state law]] (not [[federal law]]) regarding [[property]] and [[contracts]].  State law and, in some places, city law or county law, sets the requirements for [[eviction]] of a tenant.  Generally, there are a limited number of reasons for which a landlord or landlady can evict his or her tenant before the expiration of the tenancy, though at the end of the lease term the rental relationship can generally be terminated without giving any reason. Some cities, counties, and States have laws establishing the maximum rent a landlord can charge, known as rent control, or [[rent regulation]], and related [[eviction]]. There is also an [[Implied warranty of habitability#Habitability|implied warranty of habitability]], whereby a landlord must maintain safe, decent and habitable housing, meeting minimum safety requirements such as smoke detectors and a locking door.\n\n===Canada===\nIn the [[Canada]],  [[residential]] homeowner\u2013tenant disputes are primarily governed by [[provincial law]] (not [[federal law]]) regarding [[property]] and [[contracts]].  Provincial  law sets the requirements for [[eviction]] of a tenant.  Generally, there are a limited number of reasons for which a landlord  can evict a tenant. Some provinces have laws establishing the maximum rent a landlord can charge, known as rent control, or [[rent regulation]], and related [[eviction]]. There is also an [[Implied warranty of habitability#Habitability|implied warranty of habitability]], whereby a landlord must maintain safe, decent and habitable housing, meeting minimum safety requirements.\n\n==Rental investment==\nNet income received, or losses suffered, by an investor from [[renting]] of one or two properties is subject to [[Idiosyncrasy#Idiosyncrasy in economics|idiosyncratic risk]] due to the numerous things that can happen to real property and variable behavior of tenants.<ref name=NYT032913>{{cite news|title=Rental Investment May Seem Safer Than It Really Is|url=https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2013\/03\/30\/your-money\/investing-in-a-rental-home-isnt-as-safe-as-it-may-seem.html|accessdate=March 30, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 29, 2013|author=Tara Siegel Barnard}}<\/ref>\n\nRental properties can either be paid for monthly or annually depending on the agreement between the landlord and the tenant and is always included in the lease agreement and this is one of the factors that a tenant considers before moving in.  A landlord can also decide to collect a security deposit or move-in fee which can also be a consideration for the tenant.  Many factors including city\/state regulations can drive the landlord to choose one over the other.\n\n==Licensed victualler==\n{{Main article|Pub}}\n\nIn the [[United Kingdom]], the owner and\/or manager of a pub, or public house, is usually called the \"landlord\/landlady\", and often, strictly incorrectly, \"[[publican]]\", the latter properly the appellation of a Roman public contractor or [[Tax farming|tax farmer]]. In a more formal situations, the term used is '''licensed victualler''' or simply \"licensee\".<ref name='Dictionary.com'>{{cite web|url=http:\/\/dictionary.reference.com\/browse\/victualler |title= Dictionary.com |accessdate=2008-07-19 }}<\/ref> A female landlord can either be called a ''landlady'' or simply landlord.\n\nThe [[Licensed Trade Charity]], formed in 2004 from the merger of the Society of Licensed Victuallers and Licensed Victualler's National Homes,<ref>{{EW charity|230011|Society of Licensed Victuallers}}<\/ref> exists to serve the retirement needs of Britain's pub landlords. The charity also runs three private schools in [[Ascot, Berkshire|Ascot]] and [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]] in [[Berkshire]] and [[Sayers Common]] in [[Sussex]]. As well as having normal full fee paying students, [[Licensed Victuallers' School]] in Ascot provides discounted education prices for the children of landlords and others in the catering industry.\n\n==Landlord associations in Australia==\n\nThere are significant associations of  landlords in [[Australia]]. These associations\/societies provide support\nfor their  members in facing a range of issues <ref>http:\/\/www.poavic.org<\/ref>\nby providing a means of mutual support,\nand also lobby relevant authorities and parliament with regard to the details and implementation\nof residential and some commercial tenancy legislation. These associations need to be distinguished from the class of property owner associations that represent\nthe 'big end of town'   - the owners of major buildings and very large residential\nhousing complexes, such as the Property Council of Australia.<ref>http:\/\/www.propertycouncil.com.au\/<\/ref>\n\nProperty Owners Association of Australia (POAA)<ref>http:\/\/www.poaa.asn.au\/<\/ref>\n\nProperty Owners Association of Victoria (POAVIC) <ref>http:\/\/www.poavic.org<\/ref>\n\nPOAQ - Property Owners Association of Queensland <ref>http:\/\/www.poaa.asn.au\/POAQ\/index.php<\/ref>\n\nProperty Owners Association of NSW <ref>https:\/\/www.poansw.com.au\/<\/ref>\n\nProperty Owners Association of Western Australia <ref>http:\/\/www.poawa.com.au\/<\/ref>\n\nLandlords Association of South Australia <ref>http:\/\/www.landlords.org.au\/<\/ref>\n\n==References==\n{{wiktionary|landlord}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Real estate}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Real estate]]\n[[Category:Real property law]]",

    "original": "{{other uses|landlord (disambiguation)}}\n{{Redirect|Landlady|other uses|The Landlady (disambiguation){{!}}The Landlady}}\n[[File:Powerful landlord in chariot. Eastern Han 25-220 CE. Anping, Hebei.jpg|thumb|280px|Powerful landlord in chariot. [[Eastern Han]] 25-220 CE. [[Hebei]], China.]]\nA '''landlord''' is the owner of a [[house]], [[apartment]], [[condominium]], land or [[real estate]] which is [[Renting|rent]]ed or [[lease]]d to an individual or business, who is called a [[Leasehold estate|tenant]] (also a ''lessee'' or ''renter'').  When a [[juristic person]] is in this position, the term landlord is used. Other terms include '''lessor''' and '''owner'''. The term '''landlady''' may be used for [[women]] owners, and lessor applies to both genders.\n\n==History==\nThe concept of a landlord may be traced back to the [[feudalism|feudal]] system of [[manoralism]] ([[seignorialism]]), where a [[landed estate]] is owned by a [[Lord of the Manor]] ([[mesne lord]]s), usually members of the lower nobility which came to form the rank of [[knight]]s in the high medieval period, holding their fief via [[subinfeudation]], but in some cases the land may also be directly subject to a member of higher nobility, as in the [[royal domain]] directly owned by a king, or in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] [[Imperial Village|imperial villages]] directly subject to the emperor.\nThe medieval system ultimately continues the system of [[Roman villa|villas]] and [[latifundium|latifundia]] of the [[Roman Empire]].<ref>[http:\/\/faculty.history.wisc.edu\/sommerville\/123\/feudalism.htm Faculty.history.wisc.edu]<\/ref>\n\nIn modern times, landlords provide housing for persons who cannot afford or don't want to own their own homes.  This can be both a lucrative and challenging occupation.  Because the public sometimes considers renters to be a less desirable resident of a neighborhood than homeowners, a certain stigma has come to attach to the owners of rental property, especially in troubled neighborhoods.  The term \"slumlord\" is sometimes used to describe landlords in those circumstances.  In Minneapolis, such landlords rose up against city officials and, in the 2001 election, succeeded in defeating the incumbent mayor and half the city council.  But such situations are quite unusual.<ref> http:\/\/www.landlordpolitics.com\/landlord.html   Minneapolis Property Rights Action Committee events & adventures  <\/ref>\n\n==Owner and tenant==\nA [[rental agreement]], or ''lease'', is the [[contract]] defining such terms as the price paid, penalties for late payments, the length of the rental or lease, and the amount of notice required before either the homeowner or tenant cancels the agreement.  In general, responsibilities are given as follows: the homeowner is responsible for making repairs and performing property maintenance, and the tenant is responsible for keeping the property clean and safe.\n\nMany owners hire a [[property management]] company to take care of all the details of renting their property out to a tenant. This usually includes advertising the property and showing it to prospective tenants, negotiating and preparing the written leases, and then, once rented, collecting rent from the tenant and performing repairs as needed.\n\n[[Image:E9438-David-Berry-monument.jpg|thumb|Being a good landlord, [[David Berry (landowner)|David Berry]] (who had owned much of what is now known as [[Berry, New South Wales|Berry - the town was named after him]]) is well remembered by his tenants.]]\n\n===United States===\nIn the [[United States]], [[residential]] homeowner\u2013tenant disputes are primarily governed by [[state law]] (not [[federal law]]) regarding [[property]] and [[contracts]].  State law and, in some places, city law or county law, sets the requirements for [[eviction]] of a tenant.  Generally, there are a limited number of reasons for which a landlord or landlady can evict his or her tenant before the expiration of the tenancy, though at the end of the lease term the rental relationship can generally be terminated without giving any reason. Some cities, counties, and States have laws establishing the maximum rent a landlord can charge, known as rent control, or [[rent regulation]], and related [[eviction]]. There is also an [[Implied warranty of habitability#Habitability|implied warranty of habitability]], whereby a landlord must maintain safe, decent and habitable housing, meeting minimum safety requirements such as smoke detectors and a locking door.\n\n===Canada===\nIn the [[Canada]],  [[residential]] homeowner\u2013tenant disputes are primarily governed by [[provincial law]] (not [[federal law]]) regarding [[property]] and [[contracts]].  Provincial  law sets the requirements for [[eviction]] of a tenant.  Generally, there are a limited number of reasons for which a landlord  can evict a tenant. Some provinces have laws establishing the maximum rent a landlord can charge, known as rent control, or [[rent regulation]], and related [[eviction]]. There is also an [[Implied warranty of habitability#Habitability|implied warranty of habitability]], whereby a landlord must maintain safe, decent and habitable housing, meeting minimum safety requirements.\n\n==Rental investment==\nNet income received, or losses suffered, by an investor from [[renting]] of one or two properties is subject to [[Idiosyncrasy#Idiosyncrasy in economics|idiosyncratic risk]] due to the numerous things that can happen to real property and variable behavior of tenants.<ref name=NYT032913>{{cite news|title=Rental Investment May Seem Safer Than It Really Is|url=https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2013\/03\/30\/your-money\/investing-in-a-rental-home-isnt-as-safe-as-it-may-seem.html|accessdate=March 30, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 29, 2013|author=Tara Siegel Barnard}}<\/ref>\n\nRental properties can either be paid for monthly or annually depending on the agreement between the landlord and the tenant and is always included in the lease agreement and this is one of the factors that a tenant considers before moving in.  A landlord can also decide to collect a security deposit or move-in fee which can also be a consideration for the tenant.  Many factors including city\/state regulations can drive the landlord to choose one over the other.\n\n==Licensed victualler==\n{{Main article|Pub}}\n\nIn the [[United Kingdom]], the owner and\/or manager of a pub, or public house, is usually called the \"landlord\/landlady\", and often, strictly incorrectly, \"[[publican]]\", the latter properly the appellation of a Roman public contractor or [[Tax farming|tax farmer]]. In a more formal situations, the term used is '''licensed victualler''' or simply \"licensee\".<ref name='Dictionary.com'>{{cite web|url=http:\/\/dictionary.reference.com\/browse\/victualler |title= Dictionary.com |accessdate=2008-07-19 }}<\/ref> A female landlord can either be called a ''landlady'' or simply landlord.\n\nThe [[Licensed Trade Charity]], formed in 2004 from the merger of the Society of Licensed Victuallers and Licensed Victualler's National Homes,<ref>{{EW charity|230011|Society of Licensed Victuallers}}<\/ref> exists to serve the retirement needs of Britain's pub landlords. The charity also runs three private schools in [[Ascot, Berkshire|Ascot]] and [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]] in [[Berkshire]] and [[Sayers Common]] in [[Sussex]]. As well as having normal full fee paying students, [[Licensed Victuallers' School]] in Ascot provides discounted education prices for the children of landlords and others in the catering industry.\n\n==Landlord associations in Australia==\n\nThere are significant associations of  landlords in [[Australia]]. These associations\/societies provide support\nfor their  members in facing a range of issues <ref>http:\/\/www.poavic.org<\/ref>\nby providing a means of mutual support,\nand also lobby relevant authorities and parliament with regard to the details and implementation\nof residential and some commercial tenancy legislation. These associations need to be distinguished from the class of property owner associations that represent\nthe 'big end of town'   - the owners of major buildings and very large residential\nhousing complexes, such as the Property Council of Australia.<ref>http:\/\/www.propertycouncil.com.au\/<\/ref>\n\nProperty Owners Association of Australia (POAA)<ref>http:\/\/www.poaa.asn.au\/<\/ref>\n\nProperty Owners Association of Victoria (POAVIC) <ref>http:\/\/www.poavic.org<\/ref>\n\nPOAQ - Property Owners Association of Queensland <ref>http:\/\/www.poaa.asn.au\/POAQ\/index.php<\/ref>\n\nProperty Owners Association of NSW <ref>https:\/\/www.poansw.com.au\/<\/ref>\n\nProperty Owners Association of Western Australia <ref>http:\/\/www.poawa.com.au\/<\/ref>\n\nLandlords Association of South Australia <ref>http:\/\/www.landlords.org.au\/<\/ref>\n\n==References==\n{{wiktionary|landlord}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Real estate}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Real estate]]\n[[Category:Real property law]]",

    "original": "{{other uses|landlord (disambiguation)}}\n{{Redirect|Landlady|other uses|The Landlady (disambiguation){{!}}The Landlady}}\n[[File:Powerful landlord in chariot. Eastern Han 25-220 CE. Anping, Hebei.jpg|thumb|280px|Powerful landlord in chariot. [[Eastern Han]] 25-220 CE. [[Hebei]], China.]]\nA '''landlord''' is the owner of a [[house]], [[apartment]], [[condominium]], land or [[real estate]] which is [[Renting|rent]]ed or [[lease]]d to an individual or business, who is called a [[Leasehold estate|tenant]] (also a ''lessee'' or ''renter'').  When a [[juristic person]] is in this position, the term landlord is used. Other terms include '''lessor''' and '''owner'''. The term '''landlady''' may be used for [[women]] owners, and lessor applies to both genders.\n\n==History==\nThe concept of a landlord may be traced back to the [[feudalism|feudal]] system of [[manoralism]] ([[seignorialism]]), where a [[landed estate]] is owned by a [[Lord of the Manor]] ([[mesne lord]]s), usually members of the lower nobility which came to form the rank of [[knight]]s in the high medieval period, holding their fief via [[subinfeudation]], but in some cases the land may also be directly subject to a member of higher nobility, as in the [[royal domain]] directly owned by a king, or in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] [[Imperial Village|imperial villages]] directly subject to the emperor.\nThe medieval system ultimately continues the system of [[Roman villa|villas]] and [[latifundium|latifundia]] of the [[Roman Empire]].<ref>[http:\/\/faculty.history.wisc.edu\/sommerville\/123\/feudalism.htm Faculty.history.wisc.edu]<\/ref>\n\nIn modern times, landlords provide housing for persons who cannot afford or don't want to own their own homes.  This can be both a lucrative and challenging occupation.  Because the public sometimes considers renters to be a less desirable resident of a neighborhood than homeowners, a certain stigma has come to attach to the owners of rental property, especially in troubled neighborhoods.  The term \"slumlord\" is sometimes used to describe landlords in those circumstances.  In Minneapolis, such landlords rose up against city officials and, in the 2001 election, succeeded in defeating the incumbent mayor and half the city council.  But such situations are quite unusual.<ref> http:\/\/www.landlordpolitics.com\/landlord.html   Minneapolis Property Rights Action Committee events & adventures  <\/ref>\n\n==Owner and tenant==\nA [[rental agreement]], or ''lease'', is the [[contract]] defining such terms as the price paid, penalties for late payments, the length of the rental or lease, and the amount of notice required before either the homeowner or tenant cancels the agreement.  In general, responsibilities are given as follows: the homeowner is responsible for making repairs and performing property maintenance, and the tenant is responsible for keeping the property clean and safe.\n\nMany owners hire a [[property management]] company to take care of all the details of renting their property out to a tenant. This usually includes advertising the property and showing it to prospective tenants, negotiating and preparing the written leases, and then, once rented, collecting rent from the tenant and performing repairs as needed.\n\n[[Image:E9438-David-Berry-monument.jpg|thumb|Being a good landlord, [[David Berry (landowner)|David Berry]] (who had owned much of what is now known as [[Berry, New South Wales|Berry - the town was named after him]]) is well remembered by his tenants.]]\n\n===United States===\nIn the [[United States]], [[residential]] homeowner\u2013tenant disputes are primarily governed by [[state law]] (not [[federal law]]) regarding [[property]] and [[contracts]].  State law and, in some places, city law or county law, sets the requirements for [[eviction]] of a tenant.  Generally, there are a limited number of reasons for which a landlord or landlady can evict his or her tenant before the expiration of the tenancy, though at the end of the lease term the rental relationship can generally be terminated without giving any reason. Some cities, counties, and States have laws establishing the maximum rent a landlord can charge, known as rent control, or [[rent regulation]], and related [[eviction]]. There is also an [[Implied warranty of habitability#Habitability|implied warranty of habitability]], whereby a landlord must maintain safe, decent and habitable housing, meeting minimum safety requirements such as smoke detectors and a locking door.\n\n===Canada===\nIn the [[Canada]],  [[residential]] homeowner\u2013tenant disputes are primarily governed by [[provincial law]] (not [[federal law]]) regarding [[property]] and [[contracts]].  Provincial  law sets the requirements for [[eviction]] of a tenant.  Generally, there are a limited number of reasons for which a landlord  can evict a tenant. Some provinces have laws establishing the maximum rent a landlord can charge, known as rent control, or [[rent regulation]], and related [[eviction]]. There is also an [[Implied warranty of habitability#Habitability|implied warranty of habitability]], whereby a landlord must maintain safe, decent and habitable housing, meeting minimum safety requirements.\n\n==Rental investment==\nNet income received, or losses suffered, by an investor from [[renting]] of one or two properties is subject to [[Idiosyncrasy#Idiosyncrasy in economics|idiosyncratic risk]] due to the numerous things that can happen to real property and variable behavior of tenants.<ref name=NYT032913>{{cite news|title=Rental Investment May Seem Safer Than It Really Is|url=https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2013\/03\/30\/your-money\/investing-in-a-rental-home-isnt-as-safe-as-it-may-seem.html|accessdate=March 30, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 29, 2013|author=Tara Siegel Barnard}}<\/ref>\n\nRental properties can either be paid for monthly or annually depending on the agreement between the landlord and the tenant and is always included in the lease agreement and this is one of the factors that a tenant considers before moving in.  A landlord can also decide to collect a security deposit or move-in fee which can also be a consideration for the tenant.  Many factors including city\/state regulations can drive the landlord to choose one over the other.\n\n==Licensed victualler==\n{{Main article|Pub}}\n\nIn the [[United Kingdom]], the owner and\/or manager of a pub, or public house, is usually called the \"landlord\/landlady\", and often, strictly incorrectly, \"[[publican]]\", the latter properly the appellation of a Roman public contractor or [[Tax farming|tax farmer]]. In a more formal situations, the term used is '''licensed victualler''' or simply \"licensee\".<ref name='Dictionary.com'>{{cite web|url=http:\/\/dictionary.reference.com\/browse\/victualler |title= Dictionary.com |accessdate=2008-07-19 }}<\/ref> A female landlord can either be called a ''landlady'' or simply landlord.\n\nThe [[Licensed Trade Charity]], formed in 2004 from the merger of the Society of Licensed Victuallers and Licensed Victualler's National Homes,<ref>{{EW charity|230011|Society of Licensed Victuallers}}<\/ref> exists to serve the retirement needs of Britain's pub landlords. The charity also runs three private schools in [[Ascot, Berkshire|Ascot]] and [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]] in [[Berkshire]] and [[Sayers Common]] in [[Sussex]]. As well as having normal full fee paying students, [[Licensed Victuallers' School]] in Ascot provides discounted education prices for the children of landlords and others in the catering industry.\n\n==Landlord associations in Australia==\n\nThere are significant associations of  landlords in [[Australia]]. These associations\/societies provide support\nfor their  members in facing a range of issues <ref>http:\/\/www.poavic.org<\/ref>\nby providing a means of mutual support,\nand also lobby relevant authorities and parliament with regard to the details and implementation\nof residential and some commercial tenancy legislation. These associations need to be distinguished from the class of property owner associations that represent\nthe 'big end of town'   - the owners of major buildings and very large residential\nhousing complexes, such as the Property Council of Australia.<ref>http:\/\/www.propertycouncil.com.au\/<\/ref>\n\nProperty Owners Association of Australia (POAA)<ref>http:\/\/www.poaa.asn.au\/<\/ref>\n\nProperty Owners Association of Victoria (POAVIC) <ref>http:\/\/www.poavic.org<\/ref>\n\nPOAQ - Property Owners Association of Queensland <ref>http:\/\/www.poaa.asn.au\/POAQ\/index.php<\/ref>\n\nProperty Owners Association of NSW <ref>https:\/\/www.poansw.com.au\/<\/ref>\n\nProperty Owners Association of Western Australia <ref>http:\/\/www.poawa.com.au\/<\/ref>\n\nLandlords Association of South Australia <ref>http:\/\/www.landlords.org.au\/<\/ref>\n\n==References==\n{{wiktionary|landlord}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Real estate}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Real estate]]\n[[Category:Real property law]]",

Anping, Hebei.jpg|thumb|280px|Powerful landlord in chariot. [[Eastern Han]] 25-220 CE. [[Hebei]], China.]]\nA '''landlord''' is the owner of a [[house]], [[apartment]], [[condominium]], land or [[real estate]] which is [[Renting|rent]]ed or [[lease]]d to an individual or business, who is called a [[Leasehold estate|tenant]] (also a ''lessee'' or ''renter'').  When a [[juristic person]] is in this position, the term landlord is used. Other terms include '''lessor''' and '''owner'''. The term '''landlady''' may be used for [[women]] owners, and lessor applies to both genders. Common land-lording activities include killing, raping, burglarizing, robbing, and harassing tenants, as well as destroying apartments to drive tenants out. Landlords have no professional ethics, and are unmoored by common morality, decency, or law. \n\n==History==\nThe concept of a landlord may be traced back to the [[feudalism|feudal]] system of [[manoralism]] ([[seignorialism]]), where a [[landed estate]] is owned by a [[Lord of the Manor]] ([[mesne lord]]s), usually members of the lower nobility which came to form the rank of [[knight]]s in the high medieval period, holding their fief via [[subinfeudation]], but in some cases the land may also be directly subject to a member of higher nobility, as in the [[royal domain]] directly owned by a king, or in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] [[Imperial Village|imperial villages]] directly subject to the emperor.\nThe medieval system ultimately continues the system of [[Roman villa|villas]] and [[latifundium|latifundia]] of the [[Roman Empire]].<ref>[http:\/\/faculty.history.wisc.edu\/sommerville\/123\/feudalism.htm Faculty.history.wisc.edu]<\/ref>\n\nIn modern times, landlords provide housing for persons who cannot afford or don't want to own their own homes.  This can be both a lucrative and challenging occupation.  Because the public sometimes considers renters to be a less desirable resident of a neighborhood than homeowners, a certain stigma has come to attach to the owners of rental property, especially in troubled neighborhoods.  The term \"slumlord\" is sometimes used to describe landlords in those circumstances.

Anping, Hebei.jpg|thumb|280px|Powerful landlord in chariot. [[Eastern Han]] 25-220 CE. [[Hebei]], China.]]\nA '''landlord''' is the owner of a [[house]], [[apartment]], [[condominium]], land or [[real estate]] which is [[Renting|rent]]ed or [[lease]]d to an individual or business, who is called a [[Leasehold estate|tenant]] (also a ''lessee'' or ''renter'').  When a [[juristic person]] is in this position, the term landlord is used. Other terms include '''lessor''' and '''owner'''. The term '''landlady''' may be used for [[women]] owners, and lessor applies to both genders.\n\n==History==\nThe concept of a landlord may be traced back to the [[feudalism|feudal]] system of [[manoralism]] ([[seignorialism]]), where a [[landed estate]] is owned by a [[Lord of the Manor]] ([[mesne lord]]s), usually members of the lower nobility which came to form the rank of [[knight]]s in the high medieval period, holding their fief via [[subinfeudation]], but in some cases the land may also be directly subject to a member of higher nobility, as in the [[royal domain]] directly owned by a king, or in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] [[Imperial Village|imperial villages]] directly subject to the emperor.\nThe medieval system ultimately continues the system of [[Roman villa|villas]] and [[latifundium|latifundia]] of the [[Roman Empire]].<ref>[http:\/\/faculty.history.wisc.edu\/sommerville\/123\/feudalism.htm Faculty.history.wisc.edu]<\/ref>\n\nIn modern times, landlords provide housing for persons who cannot afford or don't want to own their own homes.  This can be both a lucrative and challenging occupation.  Because the public sometimes considers renters to be a less desirable resident of a neighborhood than homeowners, a certain stigma has come to attach to the owners of rental property, especially in troubled neighborhoods.  The term \"slumlord\" is sometimes used to describe landlords in those circumstances.  In Minneapolis, such landlords rose up against city officials and, in the 2001 election, succeeded in defeating the incumbent mayor and half the city council.  But such situations are quite unusual.<ref> http:\/\/www.landlordpolitics.com\/landlord.html   Minneapolis Property Rights Action Committee events & adventures  <\/ref>\n\n==Owner and tenant==\nA [[rental agreement]], or ''lease'', is the [[contract]] defining such terms as the price paid, penalties for late payments, the length of the rental or lease, and the amount of notice required before either the homeowner or tenant cancels the agreement.  In general, responsibilities are given as follows: the homeowner is responsible for making repairs and performing property maintenance, and the tenant is responsible for keeping the property clean and safe.\n\nMany owners hire a [[property management]] company to take care of all the details of renting their property out to a tenant. This usually includes advertising the property and showing it to prospective tenants, negotiating and preparing the written leases, and then, once rented, collecting rent from the tenant and performing repairs as needed.\n\n[[Image:E9438-David-Berry-monument.jpg|thumb|Being a good landlord, [[David Berry (landowner)|David Berry]] (who had owned much of what is now known as [[Berry, New South Wales|Berry - the town was named after him]]) is well remembered by his tenants.]]\n\n===United States===\nIn the [[United States]], [[residential]] homeowner\u2013tenant disputes are primarily governed by [[state law]] (not [[federal law]]) regarding [[property]] and [[contracts]].  State law and, in some places, city law or county law, sets the requirements for [[eviction]] of a tenant.  Generally, there are a limited number of reasons for which a landlord or landlady can evict his or her tenant before the expiration of the tenancy, though at the end of the lease term the rental relationship can generally be terminated without giving any reason. Some cities, counties, and States have laws establishing the maximum rent a landlord can charge, known as rent control, or [[rent regulation]], and related [[eviction]]. There is also an [[Implied warranty of habitability#Habitability|implied warranty of habitability]], whereby a landlord must maintain safe, decent and habitable housing, meeting minimum safety requirements such as smoke detectors and a locking door.\n\n===Canada===\nIn the [[Canada]],  [[residential]] homeowner\u2013tenant disputes are primarily governed by [[provincial law]] (not [[federal law]]) regarding [[property]] and [[contracts]].  Provincial  law sets the requirements for [[eviction]] of a tenant.  Generally, there are a limited number of reasons for which a landlord  can evict a tenant. Some provinces have laws establishing the maximum rent a landlord can charge, known as rent control, or [[rent regulation]], and related [[eviction]]. There is also an [[Implied warranty of habitability#Habitability|implied warranty of habitability]], whereby a landlord must maintain safe, decent and habitable housing, meeting minimum safety requirements.\n\n==Rental investment==\nNet income received, or losses suffered, by an investor from [[renting]] of one or two properties is subject to [[Idiosyncrasy#Idiosyncrasy in economics|idiosyncratic risk]] due to the numerous things that can happen to real property and variable behavior of tenants.<ref name=NYT032913>{{cite news|title=Rental Investment May Seem Safer Than It Really Is|url=https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2013\/03\/30\/your-money\/investing-in-a-rental-home-isnt-as-safe-as-it-may-seem.html|accessdate=March 30, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 29, 2013|author=Tara Siegel Barnard}}<\/ref>\n\nRental properties can either be paid for monthly or annually depending on the agreement between the landlord and the tenant and is always included in the lease agreement and this is one of the factors that a tenant considers before moving in.  A landlord can also decide to collect a security deposit or move-in fee which can also be a consideration for the tenant.  Many factors including city\/state regulations can drive the landlord to choose one over the other.\n\n==Licensed victualler==\n{{Main article|Pub}}\n\nIn the [[United Kingdom]], the owner and\/or manager of a pub, or public house, is usually called the \"landlord\/landlady\", and often, strictly incorrectly, \"[[publican]]\", the latter properly the appellation of a Roman public contractor or [[Tax farming|tax farmer]]. In a more formal situations, the term used is '''licensed victualler''' or simply \"licensee\".<ref name='Dictionary.com'>{{cite web|url=http:\/\/dictionary.reference.com\/browse\/victualler |title= Dictionary.com |accessdate=2008-07-19 }}<\/ref> A female landlord can either be called a ''landlady'' or simply landlord.\n\nThe [[Licensed Trade Charity]], formed in 2004 from the merger of the Society of Licensed Victuallers and Licensed Victualler's National Homes,<ref>{{EW charity|230011|Society of Licensed Victuallers}}<\/ref> exists to serve the retirement needs of Britain's pub landlords.

This can be both a lucrative and challenging occupation.  Because the public sometimes considers renters to be a less desirable resident of a neighborhood than homeowners, a certain stigma has come to attach to the owners of rental property, especially in troubled neighborhoods.  The term \"slumlord\" is sometimes used to describe landlords in those circumstances.  In Minneapolis, such landlords rose up against city officials and, in the 2001 election, succeeded in defeating the incumbent mayor and half the city council.  But such situations are quite unusual.<ref> http:\/\/www.landlordpolitics.com\/landlord.html   Minneapolis Property Rights Action Committee events & adventures  <\/ref>\n\n==Owner and tenant==\nA [[rental agreement]], or ''lease'', is the [[contract]] defining such terms as the price paid, penalties for late payments, the length of the rental or lease, and the amount of notice required before either the homeowner or tenant cancels the agreement.  In general, responsibilities are given as follows: the homeowner is responsible for making repairs and performing property maintenance, and the tenant is responsible for keeping the property clean and safe.\n\nMany owners hire a [[property management]] company to take care of all the details of renting their property out to a tenant. This usually includes advertising the property and showing it to prospective tenants, negotiating and preparing the written leases, and then, once rented, collecting rent from the tenant and performing repairs as needed.\n\n[[Image:E9438-David-Berry-monument.jpg|thumb|Being a good landlord, [[David Berry (landowner)|David Berry]] (who had owned much of what is now known as [[Berry, New South Wales|Berry - the town was named after him]]) is well remembered by his tenants.]]\n\n===United States===\nIn the [[United States]], [[residential]] homeowner\u2013tenant disputes are primarily governed by [[state law]] (not [[federal law]]) regarding [[property]] and [[contracts]].  State law and, in some places, city law or county law, sets the requirements for [[eviction]] of a tenant.  Generally, there are a limited number of reasons for which a landlord or landlady can evict his or her tenant before the expiration of the tenancy, though at the end of the lease term the rental relationship can generally be terminated without giving any reason. Some cities, counties, and States have laws establishing the maximum rent a landlord can charge, known as rent control, or [[rent regulation]], and related [[eviction]]. There is also an [[Implied warranty of habitability#Habitability|implied warranty of habitability]], whereby a landlord must maintain safe, decent and habitable housing, meeting minimum safety requirements such as smoke detectors and a locking door.\n\n===Canada===\nIn the [[Canada]],  [[residential]] homeowner\u2013tenant disputes are primarily governed by [[provincial law]] (not [[federal law]]) regarding [[property]] and [[contracts]].  Provincial  law sets the requirements for [[eviction]] of a tenant.  Generally, there are a limited number of reasons for which a landlord  can evict a tenant. Some provinces have laws establishing the maximum rent a landlord can charge, known as rent control, or [[rent regulation]], and related [[eviction]]. There is also an [[Implied warranty of habitability#Habitability|implied warranty of habitability]], whereby a landlord must maintain safe, decent and habitable housing, meeting minimum safety requirements.\n\n==Rental investment==\nNet income received, or losses suffered, by an investor from [[renting]] of one or two properties is subject to [[Idiosyncrasy#Idiosyncrasy in economics|idiosyncratic risk]] due to the numerous things that can happen to real property and variable behavior of tenants.<ref name=NYT032913>{{cite news|title=Rental Investment May Seem Safer Than It Really Is|url=https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2013\/03\/30\/your-money\/investing-in-a-rental-home-isnt-as-safe-as-it-may-seem.html|accessdate=March 30, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 29, 2013|author=Tara Siegel Barnard}}<\/ref>\n\nRental properties can either be paid for monthly or annually depending on the agreement between the landlord and the tenant and is always included in the lease agreement and this is one of the factors that a tenant considers before moving in.  A landlord can also decide to collect a security deposit or move-in fee which can also be a consideration for the tenant.  Many factors including city\/state regulations can drive the landlord to choose one over the other.\n\n==Licensed victualler==\n{{Main article|Pub}}\n\nIn the [[United Kingdom]], the owner and\/or manager of a pub, or public house, is usually called the \"landlord\/landlady\", and often, strictly incorrectly, \"[[publican]]\", the latter properly the appellation of a Roman public contractor or [[Tax farming|tax farmer]]. In a more formal situations, the term used is '''licensed victualler''' or simply \"licensee\".<ref name='Dictionary.com'>{{cite web|url=http:\/\/dictionary.reference.com\/browse\/victualler |title= Dictionary.com |accessdate=2008-07-19 }}<\/ref> A female landlord can either be called a ''landlady'' or simply landlord.\n\nThe [[Licensed Trade Charity]], formed in 2004 from the merger of the Society of Licensed Victuallers and Licensed Victualler's National Homes,<ref>{{EW charity|230011|Society of Licensed Victuallers}}<\/ref> exists to serve the retirement needs of Britain's pub landlords.

As well as having normal full fee paying students, [[Licensed Victuallers' School]] in Ascot provides discounted education prices for the children of landlords and others in the catering industry.\n\n==Landlord associations in Australia==\n\nThere are significant associations of  landlords in [[Australia]]. These associations\/societies provide support\nfor their  members in facing a range of issues <ref>http:\/\/www.poavic.org<\/ref>\nby providing a means of mutual support,\nand also lobby relevant authorities and parliament with regard to the details and implementation\nof residential and some commercial tenancy legislation. These associations need to be distinguished from the class of property owner associations that represent\nthe 'big end of town'   - the owners of major buildings and very large residential\nhousing complexes, such as the Property Council of Australia.<ref>http:\/\/www.propertycouncil.com.au\/<\/ref>\n\nProperty Owners Association of Australia (POAA)<ref>http:\/\/www.poaa.asn.au\/<\/ref>\n\nProperty Owners Association of Victoria (POAVIC) <ref>http:\/\/www.poavic.org<\/ref>\n\nPOAQ - Property Owners Association of Queensland <ref>http:\/\/www.poaa.asn.au\/POAQ\/index.php<\/ref>\n\nProperty Owners Association of NSW <ref>https:\/\/www.poansw.com.au\/<\/ref>\n\nProperty Owners Association of Western Australia <ref>http:\/\/www.poawa.com.au\/<\/ref>\n\nLandlords Association of South Australia <ref>http:\/\/www.landlords.org.au\/<\/ref>\n\n==References==\n{{wiktionary|landlord}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Tenement (law)]]\n\n{{Real estate}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Real estate]]\n[[Category:Real property law]]",

Anping, Hebei.jpg|thumb|280px|Powerful landlord in chariot. [[Eastern Han]] 25-220 CE. [[Hebei]], China.]]\nA '''landlord''' is the owner of a [[house]], [[apartment]], [[condominium]], land or [[real estate]] which is [[Renting|rent]]ed or [[lease]]d to an individual or business, who is called a [[Leasehold estate|tenant]] (also a ''lessee'' or ''renter'').  When a [[juristic person]] is in this position, the term landlord is used. Other terms include '''lessor''' and '''owner'''. The term '''landlady''' may be used for [[women]] owners, and lessor applies to both genders.\n\n==History==\nThe concept of a landlord may be traced back to the [[feudalism|feudal]] system of [[manoralism]] ([[seignorialism]]), where a [[landed estate]] is owned by a [[Lord of the Manor]] ([[mesne lord]]s), usually members of the lower nobility which came to form the rank of [[knight]]s in the high medieval period, holding their fief via [[subinfeudation]], but in some cases the land may also be directly subject to a member of higher nobility, as in the [[royal domain]] directly owned by a king, or in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] [[Imperial Village|imperial villages]] directly subject to the emperor.\nThe medieval system ultimately continues the system of [[Roman villa|villas]] and [[latifundium|latifundia]] of the [[Roman Empire]].<ref>[http:\/\/faculty.history.wisc.edu\/sommerville\/123\/feudalism.htm Faculty.history.wisc.edu]<\/ref>\n\nIn modern times, landlords provide housing for persons who cannot afford or don't want to own their own homes.  This can be both a lucrative and challenging occupation.  Because the public sometimes considers renters to be a less desirable resident of a neighborhood than homeowners, a certain stigma has come to attach to the owners of rental property, especially in troubled neighborhoods.  The term \"slumlord\" is sometimes used to describe landlords in those circumstances.  In Minneapolis, such landlords rose up against city officials and, in the 2001 election, succeeded in defeating the incumbent mayor and half the city council.  But such situations are quite unusual.<ref> http:\/\/www.landlordpolitics.com\/landlord.html   Minneapolis Property Rights Action Committee events & adventures  <\/ref>\n\n==Owner and tenant==\nA [[rental agreement]], or ''lease'', is the [[contract]] defining such terms as the price paid, penalties for late payments, the length of the rental or lease, and the amount of notice required before either the homeowner or tenant cancels the agreement.  In general, responsibilities are given as follows: the homeowner is responsible for making repairs and performing property maintenance, and the tenant is responsible for keeping the property clean and safe.\n\nMany owners hire a [[property management]] company to take care of all the details of renting their property out to a tenant. This usually includes advertising the property and showing it to prospective tenants, negotiating and preparing the written leases, and then, once rented, collecting rent from the tenant and performing repairs as needed.\n\n[[Image:E9438-David-Berry-monument.jpg|thumb|Being a good landlord, [[David Berry (landowner)|David Berry]] (who had owned much of what is now known as [[Berry, New South Wales|Berry - the town was named after him]]) is well remembered by his tenants.]]\n\n===United States===\nIn the [[United States]], [[residential]] homeowner\u2013tenant disputes are primarily governed by [[state law]] (not [[federal law]]) regarding [[property]] and [[contracts]].  State law and, in some places, city law or county law, sets the requirements for [[eviction]] of a tenant.  Generally, there are a limited number of reasons for which a landlord or landlady can evict his or her tenant before the expiration of the tenancy, though at the end of the lease term the rental relationship can generally be terminated without giving any reason. Some cities, counties, and States have laws establishing the maximum rent a landlord can charge, known as rent control, or [[rent regulation]], and related [[eviction]]. There is also an [[Implied warranty of habitability#Habitability|implied warranty of habitability]], whereby a landlord must maintain safe, decent and habitable housing, meeting minimum safety requirements such as smoke detectors and a locking door.\n\n===Canada===\nIn the [[Canada]],  [[residential]] homeowner\u2013tenant disputes are primarily governed by [[provincial law]] (not [[federal law]]) regarding [[property]] and [[contracts]].  Provincial  law sets the requirements for [[eviction]] of a tenant.  Generally, there are a limited number of reasons for which a landlord  can evict a tenant. Some provinces have laws establishing the maximum rent a landlord can charge, known as rent control, or [[rent regulation]], and related [[eviction]]. There is also an [[Implied warranty of habitability#Habitability|implied warranty of habitability]], whereby a landlord must maintain safe, decent and habitable housing, meeting minimum safety requirements.\n\n==Rental investment==\nNet income received, or losses suffered, by an investor from [[renting]] of one or two properties is subject to [[Idiosyncrasy#Idiosyncrasy in economics|idiosyncratic risk]] due to the numerous things that can happen to real property and variable behavior of tenants.<ref name=NYT032913>{{cite news|title=Rental Investment May Seem Safer Than It Really Is|url=https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2013\/03\/30\/your-money\/investing-in-a-rental-home-isnt-as-safe-as-it-may-seem.html|accessdate=March 30, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 29, 2013|author=Tara Siegel Barnard}}<\/ref>\n\nRental properties can either be paid for monthly or annually depending on the agreement between the landlord and the tenant and is always included in the lease agreement and this is one of the factors that a tenant considers before moving in.  A landlord can also decide to collect a security deposit or move-in fee which can also be a consideration for the tenant.  Many factors including city\/state regulations can drive the landlord to choose one over the other.\n\n==Licensed victualler==\n{{Main article|Pub}}\n\nIn the [[United Kingdom]], the owner and\/or manager of a pub, or public house, is usually called the \"landlord\/landlady\", and often, strictly incorrectly, \"[[publican]]\", the latter properly the appellation of a Roman public contractor or [[Tax farming|tax farmer]]. In a more formal situations, the term used is '''licensed victualler''' or simply \"licensee\".<ref name='Dictionary.com'>{{cite web|url=http:\/\/dictionary.reference.com\/browse\/victualler |title= Dictionary.com |accessdate=2008-07-19 }}<\/ref> A female landlord can either be called a ''landlady'' or simply landlord.\n\nThe [[Licensed Trade Charity]], formed in 2004 from the merger of the Society of Licensed Victuallers and Licensed Victualler's National Homes,<ref>{{EW charity|230011|Society of Licensed Victuallers}}<\/ref> exists to serve the retirement needs of Britain's pub landlords. The charity also runs three private schools in [[Ascot, Berkshire|Ascot]] and [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]] in [[Berkshire]] and [[Sayers Common]] in [[Sussex]]. As well as having normal full fee paying students, [[Licensed Victuallers' School]] in Ascot provides discounted education prices for the children of landlords and others in the catering industry.\n\n==Landlord associations in Australia==\n\nThere are significant associations of  landlords in [[Australia]]. These associations\/societies provide support\nfor their  members in facing a range of issues <ref>http:\/\/www.poavic.org<\/ref>\nby providing a means of mutual support,\nand also lobby relevant authorities and parliament with regard to the details and implementation\nof residential and some commercial tenancy legislation. These associations need to be distinguished from the class of property owner associations that represent\nthe 'big end of town'   - the owners of major buildings and very large residential\nhousing complexes, such as the Property Council of Australia.<ref>http:\/\/www.propertycouncil.com.au\/<\/ref>\n\nProperty Owners Association of Australia (POAA)<ref>http:\/\/www.poaa.asn.au\/<\/ref>\n\nProperty Owners Association of Victoria (POAVIC) <ref>http:\/\/www.poavic.org<\/ref>\n\nPOAQ - Property Owners Association of Queensland <ref>http:\/\/www.poaa.asn.au\/POAQ\/index.php<\/ref>\n\nProperty Owners Association of NSW <ref>https:\/\/www.poansw.com.au\/<\/ref>\n\nProperty Owners Association of Western Australia <ref>http:\/\/www.poawa.com.au\/<\/ref>\n\nLandlords Association of South Australia <ref>http:\/\/www.landlords.org.au\/<\/ref>\n\n==References==\n{{wiktionary|landlord}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Tenement (law)]]\n\n{{Real estate}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Real estate]]\n[[Category:Real property law]]",

Anping, Hebei.jpg|thumb|280px|Powerful landlord in chariot. [[Eastern Han]] 25-220 CE. [[Hebei]], China.]]\nA '''landlord''' is the owner of a [[house]], [[apartment]], [[condominium]], land or [[real estate]] which is [[Renting|rent]]ed or [[lease]]d to an individual or business, who is called a [[Leasehold estate|tenant]] (also a ''lessee'' or ''renter'').  When a [[juristic person]] is in this position, the term landlord is used. Other terms include '''lessor''' and '''owner'''. The term '''landlady''' may be used for [[women]] owners, and lessor applies to both genders.\n\n==History==\nThe concept of a landlord may be traced back to the [[feudalism|feudal]] system of [[manoralism]] ([[seignorialism]]), where a [[landed estate]] is owned by a [[Lord of the Manor]] ([[mesne lord]]s), usually members of the lower nobility which came to form the rank of [[knight]]s in the high medieval period, holding their fief via [[subinfeudation]], but in some cases the land may also be directly subject to a member of higher nobility, as in the [[royal domain]] directly owned by a king, or in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] [[Imperial Village|imperial villages]] directly subject to the emperor.\nThe medieval system ultimately continues the system of [[Roman villa|villas]] and [[latifundium|latifundia]] of the [[Roman Empire]].<ref>[http:\/\/faculty.history.wisc.edu\/sommerville\/123\/feudalism.htm Faculty.history.wisc.edu]<\/ref>\n\nIn modern times, landlords provide housing for persons who cannot afford or don't want to own their own homes.  This can be both a lucrative and challenging occupation.  Because the public sometimes considers renters to be a less desirable resident of a neighborhood than homeowners, a certain stigma has come to attach to the owners of rental property, especially in troubled neighborhoods.  The term \"slumlord\" is sometimes used to describe landlords in those circumstances.  In Minneapolis, such landlords rose up against city officials and, in the 2001 election, succeeded in defeating the incumbent mayor and half the city council.

In general, responsibilities are given as follows: the homeowner is responsible for making repairs and performing property maintenance, and the tenant is responsible for keeping the property clean and safe.\n\nMany owners hire a [[property management]] company to take care of all the details of renting their property out to a tenant.

Anping, Hebei.jpg|thumb|280px|Powerful landlord in chariot. [[Eastern Han]] 25-220 CE. [[Hebei]], China.]]\nA '''landlord''' is the owner of a [[house]], [[apartment]], [[condominium]], land or [[real estate]] which is [[Renting|rent]]ed or [[lease]]d to an individual or business, who is called a [[Leasehold estate|tenant]] (also a ''lessee'' or ''renter'').  When a [[juristic person]] is in this position, the term landlord is used. Other terms include '''lessor''' and '''owner'''. The term '''landlady''' may be used for [[women]] owners, and lessor applies to both genders.\n\n==History==\nThe concept of a landlord may be traced back to the [[feudalism|feudal]] system of [[manoralism]] ([[seignorialism]]), where a [[landed estate]] is owned by a [[Lord of the Manor]] ([[mesne lord]]s), usually members of the lower nobility which came to form the rank of [[knight]]s in the high medieval period, holding their fief via [[subinfeudation]], but in some cases the land may also be directly subject to a member of higher nobility, as in the [[royal domain]] directly owned by a king, or in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] [[Imperial Village|imperial villages]] directly subject to the emperor.\nThe medieval system ultimately continues the system of [[Roman villa|villas]] and [[latifundium|latifundia]] of the [[Roman Empire]].<ref>[http:\/\/faculty.history.wisc.edu\/sommerville\/123\/feudalism.htm Faculty.history.wisc.edu]<\/ref>\n\nIn modern times, landlords provide housing for persons who cannot afford or don't want to own their own homes.  This can be both a lucrative and challenging occupation.  Because the public sometimes considers renters to be a less desirable resident of a neighborhood than homeowners, a certain stigma has come to attach to the owners of rental property, especially in troubled neighborhoods.  The term \"slumlord\" is sometimes used to describe landlords in those circumstances.  In Minneapolis, such landlords rose up against city officials and, in the 2001 election, succeeded in defeating the incumbent mayor and half the city council.  But such situations are quite unusual.<ref> http:\/\/www.landlordpolitics.com\/landlord.html   Minneapolis Property Rights Action Committee events & adventures  <\/ref>\n\n==Owner and tenant==\nA [[rental agreement]], or ''lease'', is the [[contract]] defining such terms as the price paid, penalties for late payments, the length of the rental or lease, and the amount of notice required before either the homeowner or tenant cancels the agreement.  In general, responsibilities are given as follows: the homeowner is responsible for making repairs and performing property maintenance, and the tenant is responsible for keeping the property clean and safe.\n\nMany owners hire a [[property management]] company to take care of all the details of renting their property out to a tenant. This usually includes advertising the property and showing it to prospective tenants, negotiating and preparing the written leases, and then, once rented, collecting rent from the tenant and performing repairs as needed.\n\n[[Image:E9438-David-Berry-monument.jpg|thumb|Being a good landlord, [[David Berry (landowner)|David Berry]] (who had owned much of what is now known as [[Berry, New South Wales|Berry - the town was named after him]]) is well remembered by his tenants.]]\n\n===United States===\nIn the [[United States]], [[residential]] homeowner\u2013tenant disputes are primarily governed by [[state law]] (not [[federal law]]) regarding [[property]] and [[contracts]].  State law and, in some places, city law or county law, sets the requirements for [[eviction]] of a tenant.  Generally, there are a limited number of reasons for which a landlord or landlady can evict his or her tenant before the expiration of the tenancy, though at the end of the lease term the rental relationship can generally be terminated without giving any reason. Some cities, counties, and States have laws establishing the maximum rent a landlord can charge, known as rent control, or [[rent regulation]], and related [[eviction]].

When a [[juristic person]] is in this position, the term landlord is used. Other terms include '''lessor''' and '''owner'''. The term '''landlady''' may be used for [[women]] owners, and lessor applies to both genders.\n\n==History==\nThe concept of a landlord may be traced back to the [[feudalism|feudal]] system of [[manoralism]] ([[seignorialism]]), where a [[landed estate]] is owned by a [[Lord of the Manor]] ([[mesne lord]]s), usually members of the lower nobility which came to form the rank of [[knight]]s in the high medieval period, holding their fief via [[subinfeudation]], but in some cases the land may also be directly subject to a member of higher nobility, as in the [[royal domain]] directly owned by a king, or in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] [[Imperial Village|imperial villages]] directly subject to the emperor.\nThe medieval system ultimately continues the system of [[Roman villa|villas]] and [[latifundium|latifundia]] of the [[Roman Empire]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http:\/\/faculty.history.wisc.edu\/sommerville\/123\/feudalism.htm|title=Feudalism|author=|date=|website=faculty.history.wisc.edu|accessdate=14 March 2018}}<\/ref>\n\nIn modern times, landlords provide housing for persons who cannot afford or don't want to own their own homes.

Anping, Hebei.jpg|thumb|280px|Powerful landlord in chariot. [[Eastern Han]] 25-220 CE. [[Hebei]], China.]]\nA '''landlord''' is the owner of a [[house]], [[apartment]], [[condominium]], land or [[real estate]] which is [[Renting|rent]]ed or [[lease]]d to an individual or business, who is called a [[Leasehold estate|tenant]] (also a ''lessee'' or ''renter'').  When a [[juristic person]] is in this position, the term landlord is used. Other terms include '''lessor''' and '''owner'''. The term '''landlady''' may be used for [[women]] owners, and lessor may be used regardless of [[gender identity]].\n\n==History==\nThe concept of a landlord may be traced back to the [[feudalism|feudal]] system of [[manoralism]] ([[seignorialism]]), where a [[landed estate]] is owned by a [[Lord of the Manor]] ([[mesne lord]]s), usually members of the lower nobility which came to form the rank of [[knight]]s in the high medieval period, holding their fief via [[subinfeudation]], but in some cases the land may also be directly subject to a member of higher nobility, as in the [[royal domain]] directly owned by a king, or in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] [[Imperial Village|imperial villages]] directly subject to the emperor.\nThe medieval system ultimately continues the system of [[Roman villa|villas]] and [[latifundium|latifundia]] (peasant-worked broad farmsteads) of the [[Roman Empire]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http:\/\/faculty.history.wisc.edu\/sommerville\/123\/feudalism.htm|title=Feudalism|author=|date=|website=faculty.history.wisc.edu|accessdate=14 March 2018}}<\/ref>\n\nIn modern times, landlord describes any individual(s) or entity (e.g. government body or institution) providing housing for persons who cannot afford or do not want to own their own homes.  The incentive, certainly if not [[social housing]], is to obtain a good rental yield (annual return on investment) and prospect of property price inflation. The disincentives are the locally varying duties of landlords in repair\/maintenance and administration and potentially challenges (tenant disputes, damage, neglect, loss of rent, insurance inavailability\/disputes, economic slump, increased rate of interest on any mortgage, and negative equity or loss of investment).  \n\n===Social stigmas of lower-market landlords and tenants in a property-owning culture===\nRenters (tenants or other licensees) at the lowest end of the payment scale may be in social or economic difficulty and due to their address or length of tenure may suffer a [[social stigma]].\n\nA sometimes widely promoted [[social stigma]] can impact certain for-profit owners of rental property, especially in troubled neighborhoods.  The term \"slumlord\" \/ \"slum landlord\" is sometimes used to describe landlords in those circumstances.  \n\nIn [[Minneapolis]], such landlords rose up against city officials and, in the 2001 election, succeeded in defeating the incumbent mayor and half the city council.<ref> http:\/\/www.landlordpolitics.com\/landlord.html   Minneapolis Property Rights Action Committee events & adventures  <\/ref> [[Peter Rachman]] was a Polish-born [[landlord]] who operated in [[Notting Hill]], [[London]] in the 1950s and until his 1962 death. He became notorious for exploitation of his [[Leasehold estate|tenants]], with the word \"'''Rachmanism'''\" entering the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''. His henchmen included [[Michael X|Michael de Freitas]] (aka Michael X\/Abdul Malik), who created a reputation as a black-power leader, and [[Johnny Edgecombe]], who became a promoter of jazz and blues, which helped to keep him in the limelight.<ref name=\"Three\">[http:\/\/www.historytalk.org\/Tom%20Vague%20Pop%20History\/Chp%201.pdf ''Getting it Straight in Notting Hill Gate'', Tom Vague, 2007]<\/ref>\n\n==Owner and tenant==\nA [[rental agreement]], or ''lease'', is the [[contract]] defining such terms as the price paid, penalties for late payments, the length of the rental or lease, and the amount of notice required before either the homeowner or tenant cancels the agreement.  In general, responsibilities are given as follows: the homeowner is responsible for making repairs and performing property maintenance, and the tenant is responsible for keeping the property clean and safe.\n\nMany owners hire a [[property management]] company to take care of all the details of renting their property out to a tenant. This usually includes advertising the property and showing it to prospective tenants, negotiating and preparing the written leases, and then, once rented, collecting rent from the tenant and performing repairs as needed.\n\n[[Image:E9438-David-Berry-monument.jpg|thumb|Being a good landlord, [[David Berry (landowner)|David Berry]] (who had owned much of what is now known as [[Berry, New South Wales|Berry - the town was named after him]]) is well remembered by his tenants.]]\n\n===United States===\nIn the [[United States]], [[residential]] homeowner\u2013tenant disputes are primarily governed by [[state law]] (not [[federal law]]) regarding [[property]] and [[contracts]].  State law and, in some places, city law or county law, sets the requirements for [[eviction]] of a tenant.  Generally, there are a limited number of reasons for which a landlord or landlady can evict his or her tenant before the expiration of the tenancy, though at the end of the lease term the rental relationship can generally be terminated without giving any reason. Some cities, counties, and States have laws establishing the maximum rent a landlord can charge, known as rent control, or [[rent regulation]], and related [[eviction]]. There is also an [[Implied warranty of habitability#Habitability|implied warranty of habitability]], whereby a landlord must maintain safe, decent and habitable housing, meeting minimum safety requirements such as smoke detectors and a locking door.\n\n===Canada===\nIn [[Canada]],  [[residential]] homeowner\u2013tenant disputes are primarily governed by [[provincial law]] (not [[federal law]]) regarding [[property]] and [[contracts]].

Anping, Hebei.jpg|thumb|280px|Powerful landlord in chariot. [[Eastern Han]] 25-220 CE. [[Hebei]], China.]]\nA '''landlord''' is the owner of a [[house]], [[apartment]], [[condominium]], land or [[real estate]] which is [[Renting|rent]]ed or [[lease]]d to an individual or business, who is called a [[Leasehold estate|tenant]] (also a ''lessee'' or ''renter'').  When a [[juristic person]] is in this position, the term landlord is used. Other terms include '''lessor''' and '''owner'''. The term '''landlady''' may be used for [[women]] owners, and lessor may be used regardless of [[gender identity]].\n\n==History==\nThe concept of a landlord may be traced back to the [[feudalism|feudal]] system of [[manoralism]] ([[seignorialism]]), where a [[landed estate]] is owned by a [[Lord of the Manor]] ([[mesne lord]]s), usually members of the lower nobility which came to form the rank of [[knight]]s in the high medieval period, holding their fief via [[subinfeudation]], but in some cases the land may also be directly subject to a member of higher nobility, as in the [[royal domain]] directly owned by a king, or in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] [[Imperial Village|imperial villages]] directly subject to the emperor.\nThe medieval system ultimately continues the system of [[Roman villa|villas]] and [[latifundium|latifundia]] (peasant-worked broad farmsteads) of the [[Roman Empire]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http:\/\/faculty.history.wisc.edu\/sommerville\/123\/feudalism.htm|title=Feudalism|author=|date=|website=faculty.history.wisc.edu|accessdate=14 March 2018}}<\/ref>\n\nIn modern times, landlord describes any individual(s) or entity (e.g. government body or institution) providing housing for persons who cannot afford or do not want to own their own homes.  The incentive, certainly if not [[social housing]], is to obtain a good rental yield (annual return on investment) and prospect of property price inflation. The disincentives are the locally varying duties of landlords in repair\/maintenance and administration &mdash; and keynote risks (tenant disputes, damage, neglect, loss of rent, insurance inavailability\/disputes, economic slump, increased rate of interest on any mortgage, and negative equity or loss of investment).  \n\n===Social stigmas of lower-market landlords and tenants in a property-owning culture===\nRenters (tenants or other licensees) at the lowest end of the payment scale may be in social or economic difficulty and due to their address or length of tenure may suffer a [[social stigma]].\n\nA sometimes widely promoted [[social stigma]] can impact certain for-profit owners of rental property, especially in troubled neighborhoods.  The term \"slumlord\" \/ \"slum landlord\" is sometimes used to describe landlords in those circumstances.  \n\nIn [[Minneapolis]], such landlords rose up against city officials and, in the 2001 election, succeeded in defeating the incumbent mayor and half the city council.<ref> http:\/\/www.landlordpolitics.com\/landlord.html   Minneapolis Property Rights Action Committee events & adventures  <\/ref> [[Peter Rachman]] was a Polish-born [[landlord]] who operated in [[Notting Hill]], [[London]] in the 1950s and until his 1962 death. He became notorious for exploitation of his [[Leasehold estate|tenants]], with the word \"'''Rachmanism'''\" entering the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''. His henchmen included [[Michael X|Michael de Freitas]] (aka Michael X\/Abdul Malik), who created a reputation as a black-power leader, and [[Johnny Edgecombe]], who became a promoter of jazz and blues, which helped to keep him in the limelight.<ref name=\"Three\">[http:\/\/www.historytalk.org\/Tom%20Vague%20Pop%20History\/Chp%201.pdf ''Getting it Straight in Notting Hill Gate'', Tom Vague, 2007]<\/ref>\n\n==Owner and tenant==\nA [[rental agreement]], or ''lease'', is the [[contract]] defining such terms as the price paid, penalties for late payments, the length of the rental or lease, and the amount of notice required before either the homeowner or tenant cancels the agreement.  In general, responsibilities are given as follows: the homeowner is responsible for making repairs and performing property maintenance, and the tenant is responsible for keeping the property clean and safe.\n\nMany owners hire a [[property management]] company to take care of all the details of renting their property out to a tenant. This usually includes advertising the property and showing it to prospective tenants, negotiating and preparing the written leases, and then, once rented, collecting rent from the tenant and performing repairs as needed.\n\n[[Image:E9438-David-Berry-monument.jpg|thumb|Being a good landlord, [[David Berry (landowner)|David Berry]] (who had owned much of what is now known as [[Berry, New South Wales|Berry - the town was named after him]]) is well remembered by his tenants.]]\n\n===United States===\nIn the [[United States]], [[residential]] homeowner\u2013tenant disputes are primarily governed by [[state law]] (not [[federal law]]) regarding [[property]] and [[contracts]].  State law and, in some places, city law or county law, sets the requirements for [[eviction]] of a tenant.  Generally, there are a limited number of reasons for which a landlord or landlady can evict his or her tenant before the expiration of the tenancy, though at the end of the lease term the rental relationship can generally be terminated without giving any reason. Some cities, counties, and States have laws establishing the maximum rent a landlord can charge, known as rent control, or [[rent regulation]], and related [[eviction]]. There is also an [[Implied warranty of habitability#Habitability|implied warranty of habitability]], whereby a landlord must maintain safe, decent and habitable housing, meeting minimum safety requirements such as smoke detectors and a locking door.\n\n===Canada===\nIn [[Canada]],  [[residential]] homeowner\u2013tenant disputes are primarily governed by [[provincial law]] (not [[federal law]]) regarding [[property]] and [[contracts]].  Provincial  law sets the requirements for [[eviction]] of a tenant.  Generally, there are a limited number of reasons for which a landlord  can evict a tenant. Some provinces have laws establishing the maximum rent a landlord can charge, known as rent control, or [[rent regulation]], and related [[eviction]].

Anping, Hebei.jpg|thumb|280px|Powerful landlord in chariot. [[Eastern Han]] 25-220 CE. [[Hebei]], China.]]\nA '''landlord''' is the owner of a [[house]], [[apartment]], [[condominium]], land or [[real estate]] which is [[Renting|rent]]ed or [[lease]]d to an individual or business, who is called a [[Leasehold estate|tenant]] (also a ''lessee'' or ''renter'').  When a [[juristic person]] is in this position, the term landlord is used. Other terms include '''lessor''' and '''owner'''. The term '''landlady''' may be used for [[women]] owners, and lessor may be used regardless of [[gender identity]].\n\n==History==\nThe concept of a landlord may be traced back to the [[feudalism|feudal]] system of [[manoralism]] ([[seignorialism]]), where a [[landed estate]] is owned by a [[Lord of the Manor]] ([[mesne lord]]s), usually members of the lower nobility which came to form the rank of [[knight]]s in the high medieval period, holding their fief via [[subinfeudation]], but in some cases the land may also be directly subject to a member of higher nobility, as in the [[royal domain]] directly owned by a king, or in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] [[Imperial Village|imperial villages]] directly subject to the emperor.\nThe medieval system ultimately continues the system of [[Roman villa|villas]] and [[latifundium|latifundia]] (peasant-worked broad farmsteads) of the [[Roman Empire]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http:\/\/faculty.history.wisc.edu\/sommerville\/123\/feudalism.htm|title=Feudalism|author=|date=|website=faculty.history.wisc.edu|accessdate=14 March 2018}}<\/ref>\n\nIn modern times, landlord describes any individual(s) or entity (e.g. government body or institution) providing housing for persons who cannot afford or do not want to own their own homes.  The incentive, certainly if not [[social housing]], is to obtain a good rental yield (annual return on investment) and prospect of property price inflation. The disincentives are the locally varying duties of landlords in repair\/maintenance and administration &mdash; and keynote risks (tenant disputes, damage, neglect, loss of rent, insurance inavailability\/disputes, economic slump, increased rate of interest on any mortgage, and negative equity or loss of investment).  \n\n===Social stigmas of lower-market landlords and tenants in a property-owning culture===\nRenters (tenants or other licensees) at the lowest end of the payment scale may be in social or economic difficulty and due to their address or length of tenure may suffer a [[social stigma]].\n\nA sometimes widely promoted [[social stigma]] can impact certain for-profit owners of rental property, especially in troubled neighborhoods.  The term \"slumlord\" \/ \"slum landlord\" is sometimes used to describe landlords in those circumstances.  \n\nIn [[Minneapolis]], such landlords rose up against city officials and, in the 2001 election, succeeded in defeating the incumbent mayor and half the city council.<ref> http:\/\/www.landlordpolitics.com\/landlord.html   Minneapolis Property Rights Action Committee events & adventures  <\/ref> [[Peter Rachman]] was a Polish-born [[landlord]] who operated in [[Notting Hill]], [[London]] in the 1950s and until his 1962 death. He became notorious for exploitation of his [[Leasehold estate|tenants]], with the word \"'''Rachmanism'''\" entering the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''. His henchmen included [[Michael X|Michael de Freitas]] (aka Michael X\/Abdul Malik), who created a reputation as a black-power leader, and [[Johnny Edgecombe]], who became a promoter of jazz and blues, which helped to keep him in the limelight.<ref name=\"Three\">[http:\/\/www.historytalk.org\/Tom%20Vague%20Pop%20History\/Chp%201.pdf ''Getting it Straight in Notting Hill Gate'', Tom Vague, 2007]<\/ref>\n\n==Owner and tenant responsibilities==\nA [[rental agreement]], or ''lease'', is the [[contract]] defining such terms as the price paid, penalties for late payments, the length of the rental or lease, and the amount of notice required before either the homeowner or tenant cancels the agreement.  In general, responsibilities are given as follows: the homeowner is responsible for making repairs and performing property maintenance, and the tenant is responsible for keeping the property clean and safe.\n\nMany owners hire a [[property management]] company to take care of all the details of renting their property out to a tenant. This usually includes advertising the property and showing it to prospective tenants, negotiating and preparing the written leases, and then, once rented, collecting rent from the tenant and performing repairs as needed.\n\n[[Image:E9438-David-Berry-monument.jpg|thumb|Being a good landlord, [[David Berry (landowner)|David Berry]] (who had owned much of what is now known as [[Berry, New South Wales|Berry - the town was named after him]]) is well remembered by his tenants.]]\n\n===United States===\nIn the [[United States]], [[residential]] homeowner\u2013tenant disputes are primarily governed by [[state law]] (not [[federal law]]) regarding [[property]] and [[contracts]].  State law and, in some places, city law or county law, sets the requirements for [[eviction]] of a tenant.  Generally, there are a limited number of reasons for which a landlord or landlady can evict his or her tenant before the expiration of the tenancy, though at the end of the lease term the rental relationship can generally be terminated without giving any reason. Some cities, counties, and States have laws establishing the maximum rent a landlord can charge, known as rent control, or [[rent regulation]], and related [[eviction]]. There is also an [[Implied warranty of habitability#Habitability|implied warranty of habitability]], whereby a landlord must maintain safe, decent and habitable housing, meeting minimum safety requirements such as smoke detectors and a locking door.\n\n===Canada===\nIn [[Canada]],  [[residential]] homeowner\u2013tenant disputes are primarily governed by [[provincial law]] (not [[federal law]]) regarding [[property]] and [[contracts]].  Provincial  law sets the requirements for [[eviction]] of a tenant.  Generally, there are a limited number of reasons for which a landlord  can evict a tenant. Some provinces have laws establishing the maximum rent a landlord can charge, known as rent control, or [[rent regulation]], and related [[eviction]]. There is also an [[Implied warranty of habitability#Habitability|implied warranty of habitability]], whereby a landlord must maintain safe, decent and habitable housing, meeting minimum safety requirements.\n\n===United Kingdom===\n;Residential rental market (tenancies)\nIn residential property see the [[Landlord and Tenant Act]]s, in particular the [[Landlord and Tenant Act 1985]] which sets bare minimum standards in tenants' rights against their landlords.  Eviction under the most common type, the [[Assured Shorthold Tenancy]] is usually obtainable after six weeks of unpaid rent, and which rents can be freely increased at the end of its usual six-month duration, on proper notice given to the tenant.\n\nEach [[house in multiple occupation]], a unit the law does not regard it as a single household having more than three tenants, is subject to enhanced regulations including the [[Housing Act 2004]] and a licence to be such a landlord of such a unit is always required in some local authorities (in others, limited to the larger examples).\n\n;Residential leasehold\nTenancies above a couple of years are normally called leases and tend to be long; if more than 7 years a new leasehold estate must be Registered.  These are not governed by the above rules and are in longer examples are deliberately more akin to full ownership than tenancies.  They seldom require a sizeable [[ground rent]], hefty break\/resale charges and widely allow legislation allows such lessees (tenants) to club together to gain the right to manage, and the right to buy the landlord's interest (to collectively enfranchise) and extend their leases for a new, smaller sum (\"premium\"). In smaller examples the tenant may be able to enfranchise individually.\n\n;Commercial (business) leases and tenancies\nIn commercial property much of the law, especially as to disputes and basic responsibilities, is based on freedom of contract and implications and precedent decisions of wide-ranging case law. All businesses which are tenants (lessees) must decide whether to contract in or outside of Part 2 (i.e. II) the [[Landlord and Tenant Act 1954]] which gives them \"business security of tenure\". If not, it generally applies by default. This \"security of tenure\" is expressly subject to common reasons and associated mechanisms for a landlord to obtain back the premises.\n\n==Rental investment==\nNet income received, or losses suffered, by an investor from [[renting]] of one or two properties is subject to [[Idiosyncrasy#Idiosyncrasy in economics|idiosyncratic risk]] due to the numerous things that can happen to real property and variable behavior of tenants.<ref name=NYT032913>{{cite news|title=Rental Investment May Seem Safer Than It Really Is|url=https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2013\/03\/30\/your-money\/investing-in-a-rental-home-isnt-as-safe-as-it-may-seem.html|accessdate=March 30, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 29, 2013|author=Tara Siegel Barnard}}<\/ref>\n\nRental properties can either be paid for monthly or annually depending on the agreement between the landlord and the tenant and is always included in the lease agreement and this is one of the factors that a tenant considers before moving in.  A landlord can also decide to collect a security deposit or move-in fee which can also be a consideration for the tenant.  Many factors including city\/state regulations can drive the landlord to choose one over the other.\n\n==Licensed victualler==\n{{Main article|Pub}}\n\nIn the [[United Kingdom]], the owner and\/or manager of a pub, or public house, is usually called the \"landlord\/landlady\", and often, strictly incorrectly, \"[[publican]]\", the latter properly the appellation of a Roman public contractor or [[Tax farming|tax farmer]]. In a more formal situations, the term used is '''licensed victualler''' or simply \"licensee\".<ref name='Dictionary.com'>{{cite web|url=http:\/\/dictionary.reference.com\/browse\/victualler |title= Dictionary.com |accessdate=2008-07-19 }}<\/ref> A female landlord can either be called a ''landlady'' or simply landlord.\n\nThe [[Licensed Trade Charity]], formed in 2004 from the merger of the Society of Licensed Victuallers and Licensed Victualler's National Homes,<ref>{{EW charity|230011|Society of Licensed Victuallers}}<\/ref> exists to serve the retirement needs of Britain's pub landlords. The charity also runs three private schools in [[Ascot, Berkshire|Ascot]] and [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]] in [[Berkshire]] and [[Sayers Common]] in [[Sussex]]. As well as having normal full fee paying students, [[Licensed Victuallers' School]] in Ascot provides discounted education prices for the children of landlords and others in the catering industry.\n\n==Landlord associations in Australia==\n\nThere are significant associations of  landlords in [[Australia]]. These associations\/societies provide support\nfor their  members in facing a range of issues <ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=http:\/\/www.poavic.org|title=Property Owners Association Victoria|first=Property Owners Association of|last=Victoria|date=|website=www.poavic.org|accessdate=14 March 2018}}<\/ref>\nby providing a means of mutual support,\nand also lobby relevant authorities and parliament with regard to the details and implementation\nof residential and some commercial tenancy legislation.

Anping, Hebei.jpg|thumb|280px|Powerful landlord in chariot. [[Eastern Han]] 25-220 CE. [[Hebei]], China.]]\nA '''landlord''' is the owner of a [[house]], [[apartment]], [[condominium]], land or [[real estate]] which is [[Renting|rent]]ed or [[lease]]d to an individual or business, who is called a [[Leasehold estate|tenant]] (also a ''lessee'' or ''renter'').  When a [[juristic person]] is in this position, the term landlord is used. Other terms include '''lessor''' and '''owner'''. The term '''landlady''' may be used for [[women]] owners, and lessor may be used regardless of [[gender identity]].\n\n==History==\nThe concept of a landlord may be traced back to the [[feudalism|feudal]] system of [[manoralism]] ([[seignorialism]]), where a [[landed estate]] is owned by a [[Lord of the Manor]] ([[mesne lord]]s), usually members of the lower nobility which came to form the rank of [[knight]]s in the high medieval period, holding their fief via [[subinfeudation]], but in some cases the land may also be directly subject to a member of higher nobility, as in the [[royal domain]] directly owned by a king, or in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] [[Imperial Village|imperial villages]] directly subject to the emperor.\nThe medieval system ultimately continues the system of [[Roman villa|villas]] and [[latifundium|latifundia]] (peasant-worked broad farmsteads) of the [[Roman Empire]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http:\/\/faculty.history.wisc.edu\/sommerville\/123\/feudalism.htm|title=Feudalism|author=|date=|website=faculty.history.wisc.edu|accessdate=14 March 2018}}<\/ref>\n\nIn modern times, landlord describes any individual(s) or entity (e.g. government body or institution) providing housing for persons who cannot afford or do not want to own their own homes.  The incentive, certainly if not [[social housing]], is to obtain a good rental yield (annual return on investment) and prospect of property price inflation. The disincentives are the locally varying duties of landlords in repair\/maintenance and administration &mdash; and keynote risks (tenant disputes, damage, neglect, loss of rent, insurance inavailability\/disputes, economic slump, increased rate of interest on any mortgage, and negative equity or loss of investment).  \n\n===Social stigmas of lower-market landlords and tenants in a property-owning culture===\nRenters (tenants or other licensees) at the lowest end of the payment scale may be in social or economic difficulty and due to their address or length of tenure may suffer a [[social stigma]].\n\nA sometimes widely promoted [[social stigma]] can impact certain for-profit owners of rental property, especially in troubled neighborhoods.  The term \"slumlord\" \/ \"slum landlord\" is sometimes used to describe landlords in those circumstances.  \n\nIn [[Minneapolis]], such landlords rose up against city officials and, in the 2001 election, succeeded in defeating the incumbent mayor and half the city council.<ref> http:\/\/www.landlordpolitics.com\/landlord.html   Minneapolis Property Rights Action Committee events & adventures  <\/ref> [[Peter Rachman]] was a Polish-born [[landlord]] who operated in [[Notting Hill]], [[London]] in the 1950s and until his 1962 death. He became notorious for exploitation of his [[Leasehold estate|tenants]], with the word \"'''Rachmanism'''\" entering the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''.

In general, responsibilities are given as follows: the homeowner is responsible for making repairs and performing property maintenance, and the tenant is responsible for keeping the property clean and safe.\n\nMany owners hire a [[property management]] company to take care of all the details of renting their property out to a tenant. This usually includes advertising the property and showing it to prospective tenants, negotiating and preparing the written leases, and then, once rented, collecting rent from the tenant and performing repairs as needed.\n\n[[Image:E9438-David-Berry-monument.jpg|thumb|Being a good landlord, [[David Berry (landowner)|David Berry]] (who had owned much of what is now known as [[Berry, New South Wales|Berry - the town was named after him]]) is well remembered by his tenants.]]\n\n===United States===\nIn the [[United States]], [[residential]] homeowner\u2013tenant disputes are primarily governed by [[state law]] (not [[federal law]]) regarding [[property]] and [[contracts]].  State law and, in some places, city law or county law, sets the requirements for [[eviction]] of a tenant.  Generally, there are a limited number of reasons for which a landlord or landlady can evict his or her tenant before the expiration of the tenancy, though at the end of the lease term the rental relationship can generally be terminated without giving any reason. Some cities, counties, and States have laws establishing the maximum rent a landlord can charge, known as rent control, or [[rent regulation]], and related [[eviction]]. There is also an [[Implied warranty of habitability#Habitability|implied warranty of habitability]], whereby a landlord must maintain safe, decent and habitable housing, meeting minimum safety requirements such as smoke detectors and a locking door.\n\n===Canada===\nIn [[Canada]],  [[residential]] homeowner\u2013tenant disputes are primarily governed by [[provincial law]] (not [[federal law]]) regarding [[property]] and [[contracts]].  Provincial  law sets the requirements for [[eviction]] of a tenant.  Generally, there are a limited number of reasons for which a landlord  can evict a tenant. Some provinces have laws establishing the maximum rent a landlord can charge, known as rent control, or [[rent regulation]], and related [[eviction]]. There is also an [[Implied warranty of habitability#Habitability|implied warranty of habitability]], whereby a landlord must maintain safe, decent and habitable housing, meeting minimum safety requirements.\n\n===United Kingdom===\n{{See also|English land law#Leases and licences|Scots property law}}\n;Residential rental market (tenancies)\nIn residential property see the [[Landlord and Tenant Act]]s, in particular the [[Landlord and Tenant Act 1985]] which sets bare minimum standards in tenants' rights against their landlords.  Rents can be freely increased at the end of its usual six-month duration, on proper notice given to the tenant. A Possession Order under the most common type, the [[Assured Shorthold Tenancy]] (AST) is usually obtainable after eight weeks\/two months of unpaid rent, and at the court's discretion after serving the tenant with a [[Section 8 notice]] for a lesser period for all assured tenancies and on other convenient grounds.  If the tenancy is an AST then any possession order will not take effect until six months has passed into the initial tenancy.  A tenancy of a tenant who has been in occupation since before 1983 tends to have rights greater than stated above, see for example the [[Rent Act 1977]] and [[Protection from Eviction Act 1977]], introduced by the [[Third Wilson ministry]].\n\nEach [[house in multiple occupation]], a unit the law does not regard it as a single household having more than three tenants, is subject to enhanced regulations including the [[Housing Act 2004]] and a licence to be such a landlord of such a unit is always required in some local authorities (in others, limited to the larger examples).\n\n;Residential leasehold\nTenancies above a couple of years are normally called leases and tend to be long; if more than 7 years a new leasehold estate must be registered.<ref>[[LRA 2002]], Sch.3<\/ref> These are governed by little of the above rules and are in longer examples are deliberately more akin to full ownership than tenancies.  They seldom require a sizeable [[ground rent]]. The law has not regulated hefty break\/resale charges nor does it prevent the sale of leasehold houses; in the 2010s certain of these proposals have been widely consulted upon and are being drafted.  Broadly, legislation allows such lessees (tenants) to club together to gain the [[Right to Manage]], and the right to buy the landlord's interest (to collectively enfranchise). It allows them individually to extend their leases for a new, smaller sum (\"premium\"), which if the tenants have enfranchised will not normally be demanded\/recommended every 15-35 years.  Notice requirements and forms tend to be strict. In smaller examples the tenant, depending on a simple mathematical division of the building, may be able to enfranchise individually. Statute of 1925 implies into nearly all leases or property that they can be sold (by the lessee, assigned); allowing that some limit this to those the landlord considers reasonable, without delay. \n\nIn the overall diminishing domain of [[social housing]], exceptionally, lessees widely acquire over time the [[Right to Buy]] for a fixed discount on the market price of the home.\n\n;Commercial (business) leases and tenancies\nIn commercial property much of the law, especially as to disputes and basic responsibilities, is based on freedom of contract of the [[common law]] including the implied terms of precedent decisions of wide-ranging case law such as the meaning of \"good and substantial repair\". Implied principles include \"non-derogation from grant\" and \"quiet enjoyment\". All businesses which are tenants (lessees) must decide whether to contract in or outside of Part 2 (i.e. II) the [[Landlord and Tenant Act 1954]] which gives them \"business security of tenure\". If not, it generally applies by default. This \"security of tenure\" is expressly subject to common reasons and associated mechanisms for a landlord to obtain back the premises.  If a landlord is selling a block and a qualifying tenant occupies more than 50%, the tenant should be given the [[right of first refusal]] at the asking price to buy the block. As in most jurisdictions the law on rigorous adherence to lease terms on unlawful subletting and assignment can be strictly enforced, resulting in financial and premises loss if broken. Failure to repay a rent demand, unlike residential, can result in direct landlord's repossession (\"peaceable re-entry\").\n\n==Rental investment==\nNet income received, or losses suffered, by an investor from [[renting]] of one or two properties is subject to [[Idiosyncrasy#Idiosyncrasy in economics|idiosyncratic risk]] due to the numerous things that can happen to real property and variable behavior of tenants.<ref name=NYT032913>{{cite news|title=Rental Investment May Seem Safer Than It Really Is|url=https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2013\/03\/30\/your-money\/investing-in-a-rental-home-isnt-as-safe-as-it-may-seem.html|accessdate=March 30, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 29, 2013|author=Tara Siegel Barnard}}<\/ref>\n\nRental properties can either be paid for monthly or annually depending on the agreement between the landlord and the tenant and is always included in the lease agreement and this is one of the factors that a tenant considers before moving in.  A landlord can also decide to collect a security deposit or move-in fee which can also be a consideration for the tenant.  Many factors including city\/state regulations can drive the landlord to choose one over the other.\n\n==Licensed victualler==\n{{Main article|Pub}}\n\nIn the [[United Kingdom]], the owner and\/or manager of a pub, or public house, is usually called the \"landlord\/landlady\", and often, strictly incorrectly, \"[[publican]]\", the latter properly the appellation of a Roman public contractor or [[Tax farming|tax farmer]]. In a more formal situations, the term used is '''licensed victualler''' or simply \"licensee\".<ref name='Dictionary.com'>{{cite web|url=http:\/\/dictionary.reference.com\/browse\/victualler |title= Dictionary.com |accessdate=2008-07-19 }}<\/ref> A female landlord can either be called a ''landlady'' or simply landlord.\n\nThe [[Licensed Trade Charity]], formed in 2004 from the merger of the Society of Licensed Victuallers and Licensed Victualler's National Homes,<ref>{{EW charity|230011|Society of Licensed Victuallers}}<\/ref> exists to serve the retirement needs of Britain's pub landlords.

As well as having normal full fee paying students, [[Licensed Victuallers' School]] in Ascot provides discounted education prices for the children of landlords and others in the catering industry.\n\n==Landlord associations in Australia==\n\nThere are significant associations of  landlords in [[Australia]].

Anping, Hebei.jpg|thumb|280px|Powerful landlord in chariot. [[Eastern Han]] 25-220 CE. [[Hebei]], China.]]\nA '''landlord''' is the owner of a [[house]], [[apartment]], [[condominium]], land or [[real estate]] which is [[Renting|rent]]ed or [[lease]]d to an individual or business, who is called a [[Leasehold estate|tenant]] (also a ''lessee'' or ''renter'').  When a [[juristic person]] is in this position, the term landlord is used. Other terms include '''lessor''' and '''owner'''. The term '''landlady''' may be used for [[women]] owners, and lessor may be used regardless of [[gender identity]].\n\n==History==\nThe concept of a landlord may be traced back to the [[feudalism|feudal]] system of [[manoralism]] ([[seignorialism]]), where a [[landed estate]] is owned by a [[Lord of the Manor]] ([[mesne lord]]s), usually members of the lower nobility which came to form the rank of [[knight]]s in the high medieval period, holding their fief via [[subinfeudation]], but in some cases the land may also be directly subject to a member of higher nobility, as in the [[royal domain]] directly owned by a king, or in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] [[Imperial Village|imperial villages]] directly subject to the emperor.\nThe medieval system ultimately continues the system of [[Roman villa|villas]] and [[latifundium|latifundia]] (peasant-worked broad farmsteads) of the [[Roman Empire]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http:\/\/faculty.history.wisc.edu\/sommerville\/123\/feudalism.htm|title=Feudalism|author=|date=|website=faculty.history.wisc.edu|accessdate=14 March 2018}}<\/ref>\n\nIn modern times, landlord describes any individual(s) or entity (e.g. government body or institution) providing housing for persons who cannot afford or do not want to own their own homes.  The incentive, certainly if not [[social housing]], is to obtain a good rental yield (annual return on investment) and prospect of property price inflation. The disincentives are the locally varying duties of landlords in repair\/maintenance and administration &mdash; and keynote risks (tenant disputes, damage, neglect, loss of rent, insurance inavailability\/disputes, economic slump, increased rate of interest on any mortgage, and negative equity or loss of investment).  \n\n===Social stigmas of lower-market landlords and tenants in a property-owning culture===\nRenters (tenants or other licensees) at the lowest end of the payment scale may be in social or economic difficulty and due to their address or length of tenure may suffer a [[social stigma]].\n\nA sometimes widely promoted social stigma can impact certain for-profit owners of rental property, especially in troubled neighborhoods.  The term \"slumlord\" \/ \"slum landlord\" is sometimes used to describe landlords in those circumstances.  Public improvement money\/private major economic investment can improve areas and negate the stigma.  In the extreme government [[compulsory purchase]] powers in many countries enable [[slum clearance]] to replace the worst of neighbourhoods.\n\nExamples:\n*In [[Minneapolis]], downmarket landlords vocally and financially opposed a major reform and redevelopment plan of city officials and, in the 2001 election, succeeded in defeating the incumbent mayor and half the city council.<ref> http:\/\/www.landlordpolitics.com\/landlord.html Minneapolis Property Rights Action Committee events & adventures<\/ref> \n\n*[[Peter Rachman]] was a [[landlord]] who operated in [[Notting Hill]], [[London]] in the 1950s and until his 1962 death. He became notorious for exploitation of his [[Leasehold estate|tenants]], with the word \"'''Rachmanism'''\" entering the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''.

If the tenancy is an AST then any possession order will not take effect until six months has passed into the initial tenancy.  A tenancy of a tenant who has been in occupation since before 1983 tends to have rights greater than stated above, see for example the [[Rent Act 1977]] and [[Protection from Eviction Act 1977]], introduced by the [[Third Wilson ministry]].\n\nEach [[house in multiple occupation]], a unit the law does not regard it as a single household having more than three tenants, is subject to enhanced regulations including the [[Housing Act 2004]] and a licence to be such a landlord of such a unit is always required in some local authorities (in others, limited to the larger examples).\n\n;Residential leasehold\nTenancies above a couple of years are normally called leases and tend to be long; if more than 7 years a new leasehold estate must be registered.<ref>[[LRA 2002]], Sch.3<\/ref> These are governed by little of the above rules and are in longer examples are deliberately more akin to full ownership than tenancies.  They seldom require a sizeable [[ground rent]]. The law has not regulated hefty break\/resale charges nor does it prevent the sale of leasehold houses; in the 2010s certain of these proposals have been widely consulted upon and are being drafted.  Broadly, legislation allows such lessees (tenants) to club together to gain the [[Right to Manage]], and the right to buy the landlord's interest (to collectively enfranchise). It allows them individually to extend their leases for a new, smaller sum (\"premium\"), which if the tenants have enfranchised will not normally be demanded\/recommended every 15-35 years.  Notice requirements and forms tend to be strict. In smaller examples the tenant, depending on a simple mathematical division of the building, may be able to enfranchise individually. Statute of 1925 implies into nearly all leases or property that they can be sold (by the lessee, assigned); allowing that some limit this to those the landlord considers reasonable, without delay. \n\nIn the overall diminishing domain of [[social housing]], exceptionally, lessees widely acquire over time the [[Right to Buy]] for a fixed discount on the market price of the home.\n\n;Commercial (business) leases and tenancies\nIn commercial property much of the law, especially as to disputes and basic responsibilities, is based on freedom of contract of the [[common law]] including the implied terms of precedent decisions of wide-ranging case law such as the meaning of \"good and substantial repair\". Implied principles include \"non-derogation from grant\" and \"quiet enjoyment\". All businesses which are tenants (lessees) must decide whether to contract in or outside of Part 2 (i.e. II) the [[Landlord and Tenant Act 1954]] which gives them \"business security of tenure\". If not, it generally applies by default. This \"security of tenure\" is expressly subject to common reasons and associated mechanisms for a landlord to obtain back the premises.  If a landlord is selling a block and a qualifying tenant occupies more than 50%, the tenant should be given the [[right of first refusal]] at the asking price to buy the block. As in most jurisdictions the law on rigorous adherence to lease terms on unlawful subletting and assignment can be strictly enforced, resulting in financial and premises loss if broken. Failure to repay a rent demand, unlike residential, can result in direct landlord's repossession (\"peaceable re-entry\").\n\n==Rental investment==\nNet income received, or losses suffered, by an investor from [[renting]] of one or two properties is subject to [[Idiosyncrasy#Idiosyncrasy in economics|idiosyncratic risk]] due to the numerous things that can happen to real property and variable behavior of tenants.<ref name=NYT032913>{{cite news|title=Rental Investment May Seem Safer Than It Really Is|url=https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2013\/03\/30\/your-money\/investing-in-a-rental-home-isnt-as-safe-as-it-may-seem.html|accessdate=March 30, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 29, 2013|author=Tara Siegel Barnard}}<\/ref>\n\nRental properties can either be paid for monthly or annually depending on the agreement between the landlord and the tenant and is always included in the lease agreement and this is one of the factors that a tenant considers before moving in.  A landlord can also decide to collect a security deposit or move-in fee which can also be a consideration for the tenant.  Many factors including city\/state regulations can drive the landlord to choose one over the other.\n\n==Licensed victualler==\n{{Main article|Pub}}\n\nIn the [[United Kingdom]], the owner and\/or manager of a pub, or public house, is usually called the \"landlord\/landlady\", and often, strictly incorrectly, \"[[publican]]\", the latter properly the appellation of a Roman public contractor or [[Tax farming|tax farmer]]. In a more formal situations, the term used is '''licensed victualler''' or simply \"licensee\".<ref name='Dictionary.com'>{{cite web|url=http:\/\/dictionary.reference.com\/browse\/victualler |title= Dictionary.com |accessdate=2008-07-19 }}<\/ref> A female landlord can either be called a ''landlady'' or simply landlord.\n\nThe [[Licensed Trade Charity]], formed in 2004 from the merger of the Society of Licensed Victuallers and Licensed Victualler's National Homes,<ref>{{EW charity|230011|Society of Licensed Victuallers}}<\/ref> exists to serve the retirement needs of Britain's pub landlords. The charity also runs three private schools in [[Ascot, Berkshire|Ascot]] and [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]] in [[Berkshire]] and [[Sayers Common]] in [[Sussex]]. As well as having normal full fee paying students, [[Licensed Victuallers' School]] in Ascot provides discounted education prices for the children of landlords and others in the catering industry.\n\n==Landlord associations in Australia==\n\nThere are significant associations of  landlords in [[Australia]]. These associations\/societies provide support\nfor their  members in facing a range of issues <ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=http:\/\/www.poavic.org|title=Property Owners Association Victoria|first=Property Owners Association of|last=Victoria|date=|website=www.poavic.org|accessdate=14 March 2018}}<\/ref>\nby providing a means of mutual support,\nand also lobby relevant authorities and parliament with regard to the details and implementation\nof residential and some commercial tenancy legislation.

Anping, Hebei.jpg|thumb|280px|Powerful landlord in chariot. [[Eastern Han]] 25-220 CE. [[Hebei]], China.]]\nA '''landlord''' is the owner of a [[house]], [[apartment]], [[condominium]], land or [[real estate]] which is [[Renting|rent]]ed or [[lease]]d to an individual or business, who is called a [[Leasehold estate|tenant]] (also a ''lessee'' or ''renter'').  When a [[juristic person]] is in this position, the term landlord is used. Other terms include '''lessor''' and '''owner'''. The term '''landlady''' may be used for [[women]] owners, and lessor may be used regardless of [[gender identity]].\n\n==History==\nThe concept of a landlord may be traced back to the [[feudalism|feudal]] system of [[manoralism]] ([[seignorialism]]), where a [[landed estate]] is owned by a [[Lord of the Manor]] ([[mesne lord]]s), usually members of the lower nobility which came to form the rank of [[knight]]s in the high medieval period, holding their fief via [[subinfeudation]], but in some cases the land may also be directly subject to a member of higher nobility, as in the [[royal domain]] directly owned by a king, or in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] [[Imperial Village|imperial villages]] directly subject to the emperor.\nThe medieval system ultimately continues the system of [[Roman villa|villas]] and [[latifundium|latifundia]] (peasant-worked broad farmsteads) of the [[Roman Empire]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http:\/\/faculty.history.wisc.edu\/sommerville\/123\/feudalism.htm|title=Feudalism|author=|date=|website=faculty.history.wisc.edu|accessdate=14 March 2018}}<\/ref>\n\nIn modern times, landlord describes any individual(s) or entity (e.g. government body or institution) providing housing for persons who cannot afford or do not want to own their own homes.  The incentive, certainly if not [[social housing]], is to obtain a good rental yield (annual return on investment) and prospect of property price inflation. The disincentives are the locally varying duties of landlords in repair\/maintenance and administration &mdash; and keynote risks (tenant disputes, damage, neglect, loss of rent, insurance inavailability\/disputes, economic slump, increased rate of interest on any mortgage, and negative equity or loss of investment).  \n\n===Social stigmas of lower-market landlords and tenants in a property-owning culture===\nRenters (tenants or other licensees) at the lowest end of the payment scale may be in social or economic difficulty and due to their address or length of tenure may suffer a [[social stigma]].\n\nA sometimes widely promoted social stigma can impact certain for-profit owners of rental property, especially in troubled neighborhoods.  The term \"slumlord\" \/ \"slum landlord\" is sometimes used to describe landlords in those circumstances.  Public improvement money\/private major economic investment can improve areas and negate the stigma.  In the extreme government [[compulsory purchase]] powers in many countries enable [[slum clearance]] to replace the worst of neighbourhoods.\n\nExamples:\n*In [[Minneapolis]], downmarket landlords vocally and financially opposed a major reform and redevelopment plan of city officials and, in the 2001 election, succeeded in defeating the incumbent mayor and half the city council.<ref> http:\/\/www.landlordpolitics.com\/landlord.html Minneapolis Property Rights Action Committee events & adventures<\/ref> \n\n*[[Peter Rachman]] was a [[landlord]] who operated in [[Notting Hill]], [[London]] in the 1950s and until his 1962 death. He became notorious for exploitation of his [[Leasehold estate|tenants]], with the word \"'''Rachmanism'''\" entering the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''. His henchmen included [[Michael X|Michael de Freitas]] (aka Michael X\/Abdul Malik), who created a reputation as a black-power leader, and [[Johnny Edgecombe]], who became a promoter of jazz and blues, which helped to keep him in the limelight.<ref name=\"Three\">[http:\/\/www.historytalk.org\/Tom%20Vague%20Pop%20History\/Chp%201.pdf ''Getting it Straight in Notting Hill Gate'', Tom Vague, 2007]<\/ref>\n\n==Owner and tenant responsibilities==\nA [[rental agreement]], or ''lease'', is the [[contract]] defining such terms as the price paid, penalties for late payments, the length of the rental or lease, and the amount of notice required before either the homeowner or tenant cancels the agreement.  In general, responsibilities are given as follows: the homeowner is responsible for making repairs and performing property maintenance, and the tenant is responsible for keeping the property clean and safe.\n\nMany owners hire a [[property management]] company to take care of all the details of renting their property out to a tenant. This usually includes advertising the property and showing it to prospective tenants, negotiating and preparing the written leases, and then, once rented, collecting rent from the tenant and performing repairs as needed.\n\n[[Image:E9438-David-Berry-monument.jpg|thumb|Being a good landlord, [[David Berry (landowner)|David Berry]] (who had owned much of what is now known as [[Berry, New South Wales|Berry - the town was named after him]]) is well remembered by his tenants.]]\n\n===United States===\nIn the [[United States]], [[residential]] homeowner\u2013tenant disputes are primarily governed by [[state law]] (not [[federal law]]) regarding [[property]] and [[contracts]].  State law and, in some places, city law or county law, sets the requirements for [[eviction]] of a tenant.  Generally, there are a limited number of reasons for which a landlord or landlady can evict his or her tenant before the expiration of the tenancy, though at the end of the lease term the rental relationship can generally be terminated without giving any reason. Some cities, counties, and States have laws establishing the maximum rent a landlord can charge, known as rent control, or [[rent regulation]], and related [[eviction]]. There is also an [[Implied warranty of habitability#Habitability|implied warranty of habitability]], whereby a landlord must maintain safe, decent and habitable housing, meeting minimum safety requirements such as smoke detectors and a locking door.\n\n===Canada===\nIn [[Canada]],  [[residential]] homeowner\u2013tenant disputes are primarily governed by [[provincial law]] (not [[federal law]]) regarding [[property]] and [[contracts]].  Provincial  law sets the requirements for [[eviction]] of a tenant.  Generally, there are a limited number of reasons for which a landlord  can evict a tenant. Some provinces have laws establishing the maximum rent a landlord can charge, known as rent control, or [[rent regulation]], and related [[eviction]]. There is also an [[Implied warranty of habitability#Habitability|implied warranty of habitability]], whereby a landlord must maintain safe, decent and habitable housing, meeting minimum safety requirements.\n\n===United Kingdom===\n{{See also|English land law#Leases and licences|Scots property law}}\n;Residential rental market (tenancies)\nPrivate sector renting is largely governed by many of the [[Landlord and Tenant Act]]s, in particular the [[Landlord and Tenant Act 1985]] which sets bare minimum standards in tenants' rights against their landlords.  Another key statute is the [[Housing Act 2004]].  Rents can be freely increased at the end of a usual six-month duration, on proper notice given to the tenant. A Possession Order under the most common type, the [[Assured Shorthold Tenancy]] (AST) is usually obtainable after eight weeks\/two months of unpaid rent, and at the court's discretion after serving the tenant with a [[Section 8 notice]] (under the [[Housing Act 1988]] as amended) for a lesser period for all assured tenancies &mdash; and on other grounds which defer to the landlord's ownership of the property.  If the tenancy is an AST then any possession order will not take effect until six months has passed into the initial tenancy.  A tenancy of someone who has been in occupation since before 15 January 1989 usually, if not a shorthold from the outset following their inception from 1980 onwards, has a \"[[regulated tenancy]]\" with many more rights, especially under the [[Rent Act 1977]] and [[Protection from Eviction Act 1977]], introduced by the [[Third Wilson ministry]].<ref>http:\/\/assets.publishing.service.gov.uk\/government\/uploads\/system\/uploads\/attachment_data\/file\/11445\/138295.pdf<\/ref>\n\nEach [[house in multiple occupation]], a unit the law does not regard it as a single household having more than three tenants, is subject to enhanced regulations including the [[Housing Act 2004]] and a licence to be such a landlord of such a unit is always required in some local authorities (in others, limited to the larger examples).\n\n;Residential leasehold\nTenancies above a couple of years are normally called leases and tend to be long; if more than 7 years a new leasehold estate must be registered.<ref>[[LRA 2002]], Sch.3<\/ref> These are governed by little of the above rules and are in longer examples are deliberately more akin to full ownership than tenancies.  They seldom require a sizeable [[ground rent]]. The law has not regulated hefty break\/resale charges nor does it prevent the sale of leasehold houses; in the 2010s certain of these proposals have been widely consulted upon and are being drafted.  Broadly, legislation allows such lessees (tenants) to club together to gain the [[Right to Manage]], and the right to buy the landlord's interest (to collectively enfranchise). It allows them individually to extend their leases for a new, smaller sum (\"premium\"), which if the tenants have enfranchised will not normally be demanded\/recommended every 15-35 years.  Notice requirements and forms tend to be strict. In smaller examples the tenant, depending on a simple mathematical division of the building, may be able to enfranchise individually. Statute of 1925 implies into nearly all leases or property that they can be sold (by the lessee, assigned); allowing that some limit this to those the landlord considers reasonable, without delay. \n\nIn the overall diminishing domain of [[social housing]], exceptionally, lessees widely acquire over time the [[Right to Buy]] for a fixed discount on the market price of the home.\n\n;Commercial (business) leases and tenancies\nIn commercial property much of the law, especially as to disputes and basic responsibilities, is based on freedom of contract of the [[common law]] including the implied terms of precedent decisions of wide-ranging case law such as the meaning of \"good and substantial repair\". Implied principles include \"non-derogation from grant\" and \"quiet enjoyment\". All businesses which are tenants (lessees) must decide whether to contract in or outside of Part 2 (i.e. II) the [[Landlord and Tenant Act 1954]] which gives them \"business security of tenure\". If not, it generally applies by default. This \"security of tenure\" is expressly subject to common reasons and associated mechanisms for a landlord to obtain back the premises.  If a landlord is selling a block and a qualifying tenant occupies more than 50%, the tenant should be given the [[right of first refusal]] at the asking price to buy the block. As in most jurisdictions the law on rigorous adherence to lease terms on unlawful subletting and assignment can be strictly enforced, resulting in financial and premises loss if broken. Failure to repay a rent demand, unlike residential, can result in direct landlord's repossession (\"peaceable re-entry\").  The taking of a tenant's good without a court order ([[Distress (law)|distress]]) has been banned.<ref>[http:\/\/researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk\/documents\/SN04103\/SN04103.pdf ''Bailiffs''] Lorraine Conway and Jack Dent.

A landlord can also decide to collect a security deposit or move-in fee which can also be a consideration for the tenant.  Many factors including city\/state regulations can drive the landlord to choose one over the other.\n\n==Licensed victualler==\n{{Main article|Pub}}\n\nIn the [[United Kingdom]], the owner and\/or manager of a pub, or public house, is usually called the \"landlord\/landlady\", and often, strictly incorrectly, \"[[publican]]\", the latter properly the appellation of a Roman public contractor or [[Tax farming|tax farmer]].

Anping, Hebei.jpg|thumb|280px|Powerful landlord in chariot. [[Eastern Han]] 25-220 CE. [[Hebei]], China.]]\nA '''landlord''' is the owner of a [[house]], [[apartment]], [[condominium]], land or [[real estate]] which is [[Renting|rent]]ed or [[lease]]d to an individual or business, who is called a [[Leasehold estate|tenant]] (also a ''lessee'' or ''renter'').  When a [[juristic person]] is in this position, the term landlord is used. Other terms include '''lessor''' and '''owner'''. The term '''landlady''' may be used for [[women]] owners, and lessor may be used regardless of [[gender identity]].\n\n==History==\nThe concept of a landlord may be traced back to the [[feudalism|feudal]] system of [[manoralism]] ([[seignorialism]]), where a [[landed estate]] is owned by a [[Lord of the Manor]] ([[mesne lord]]s), usually members of the lower nobility which came to form the rank of [[knight]]s in the high medieval period, holding their fief via [[subinfeudation]], but in some cases the land may also be directly subject to a member of higher nobility, as in the [[royal domain]] directly owned by a king, or in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] [[Imperial Village|imperial villages]] directly subject to the emperor.\nThe medieval system ultimately continues the system of [[Roman villa|villas]] and [[latifundium|latifundia]] (peasant-worked broad farmsteads) of the [[Roman Empire]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http:\/\/faculty.history.wisc.edu\/sommerville\/123\/feudalism.htm|title=Feudalism|author=|date=|website=faculty.history.wisc.edu|accessdate=14 March 2018}}<\/ref>\n\nIn modern times, landlord describes any individual(s) or entity (e.g. government body or institution) providing housing for persons who cannot afford or do not want to own their own homes.  The incentive, certainly if not [[social housing]], is to obtain a good rental yield (annual return on investment) and prospect of property price inflation. The disincentives are the locally varying duties of landlords in repair\/maintenance and administration &mdash; and keynote risks (tenant disputes, damage, neglect, loss of rent, insurance inavailability\/disputes, economic slump, increased rate of interest on any mortgage, and negative equity or loss of investment).  \n\n===Social stigmas of lower-market landlords and tenants in a property-owning culture===\nRenters (tenants or other licensees) at the lowest end of the payment scale may be in social or economic difficulty and due to their address or length of tenure may suffer a [[social stigma]].\n\nA sometimes widely promoted social stigma can impact certain for-profit owners of rental property, especially in troubled neighborhoods.  The term \"slumlord\" \/ \"slum landlord\" is sometimes used to describe landlords in those circumstances.  Public improvement money\/private major economic investment can improve areas and negate the stigma.  In the extreme government [[compulsory purchase]] powers in many countries enable [[slum clearance]] to replace the worst of neighbourhoods.\n\nExamples:\n*In [[Minneapolis]], downmarket landlords vocally and financially opposed a major reform and redevelopment plan of city officials and, in the 2001 election, succeeded in defeating the incumbent mayor and half the city council.<ref> http:\/\/www.landlordpolitics.com\/landlord.html Minneapolis Property Rights Action Committee events & adventures<\/ref> \n\n*[[Peter Rachman]] was a [[landlord]] who operated in [[Notting Hill]], [[London]] in the 1950s and until his 1962 death. He became notorious for exploitation of his [[Leasehold estate|tenants]], with the word \"'''Rachmanism'''\" entering the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''. His henchmen included [[Michael X|Michael de Freitas]] (aka Michael X\/Abdul Malik), who created a reputation as a black-power leader, and [[Johnny Edgecombe]], who became a promoter of jazz and blues, which helped to keep him in the limelight.<ref name=\"Three\">[http:\/\/www.historytalk.org\/Tom%20Vague%20Pop%20History\/Chp%201.pdf ''Getting it Straight in Notting Hill Gate'', Tom Vague, 2007]<\/ref>\n\n==Owner and tenant responsibilities==\nA [[rental agreement]], or ''lease'', is the [[contract]] defining such terms as the price paid, penalties for late payments, the length of the rental or lease, and the amount of notice required before either the homeowner or tenant cancels the agreement.  In general, responsibilities are given as follows: the homeowner is responsible for making repairs and performing property maintenance, and the tenant is responsible for keeping the property clean and safe.\n\nMany owners hire a [[property management]] company to take care of all the details of renting their property out to a tenant. This usually includes advertising the property and showing it to prospective tenants, negotiating and preparing the written leases, and then, once rented, collecting rent from the tenant and performing repairs as needed.\n\n[[Image:E9438-David-Berry-monument.jpg|thumb|Being a good landlord, [[David Berry (landowner)|David Berry]] (who had owned much of what is now known as [[Berry, New South Wales|Berry - the town was named after him]]) is well remembered by his tenants.]]\n\n===United States===\nIn the [[United States]], [[residential]] homeowner\u2013tenant disputes are primarily governed by [[state law]] (not [[federal law]]) regarding [[property]] and [[contracts]].  State law and, in some places, city law or county law, sets the requirements for [[eviction]] of a tenant.  Generally, there are a limited number of reasons for which a landlord or landlady can evict his or her tenant before the expiration of the tenancy, though at the end of the lease term the rental relationship can generally be terminated without giving any reason. Some cities, counties, and States have laws establishing the maximum rent a landlord can charge, known as rent control, or [[rent regulation]], and related [[eviction]]. There is also an [[Implied warranty of habitability#Habitability|implied warranty of habitability]], whereby a landlord must maintain safe, decent and habitable housing, meeting minimum safety requirements such as smoke detectors and a locking door.\n\n===Canada===\nIn [[Canada]],  [[residential]] homeowner\u2013tenant disputes are primarily governed by [[provincial law]] (not [[federal law]]) regarding [[property]] and [[contracts]].  Provincial  law sets the requirements for [[eviction]] of a tenant.  Generally, there are a limited number of reasons for which a landlord  can evict a tenant. Some provinces have laws establishing the maximum rent a landlord can charge, known as rent control, or [[rent regulation]], and related [[eviction]]. There is also an [[Implied warranty of habitability#Habitability|implied warranty of habitability]], whereby a landlord must maintain safe, decent and habitable housing, meeting minimum safety requirements.\n\n===United Kingdom===\n{{See also|English land law#Leases and licences|Scots property law}}\n;Residential rental market (tenancies)\nPrivate sector renting is largely governed by many of the [[Landlord and Tenant Act]]s, in particular the [[Landlord and Tenant Act 1985]] which sets bare minimum standards in tenants' rights against their landlords.  Another key statute is the [[Housing Act 2004]].  Rents can be freely increased at the end of a usual six-month duration, on proper notice given to the tenant. A Possession Order under the most common type, the [[Assured Shorthold Tenancy]] (AST) is usually obtainable after eight weeks\/two months of unpaid rent, and at the court's discretion after serving the tenant with a [[Section 8 notice]] (under the [[Housing Act 1988]] as amended) for a lesser period for all assured tenancies &mdash; and on other grounds which defer to the landlord's ownership of the property.  If the tenancy is an AST then any possession order will not take effect until six months has passed into the initial tenancy.  A tenancy of someone who has been in occupation since before 15 January 1989 usually, if not a shorthold from the outset following their inception from 1980 onwards, may be a \"[[regulated tenancy]]\" with many more rights, especially under the [[Rent Act 1977]] and [[Protection from Eviction Act 1977]], introduced by the [[Third Wilson ministry]].<ref>http:\/\/assets.publishing.service.gov.uk\/government\/uploads\/system\/uploads\/attachment_data\/file\/11445\/138295.pdf<\/ref>\n\nEach [[house in multiple occupation]], a unit the law does not regard it as a single household having more than three tenants, is subject to enhanced regulations including the [[Housing Act 2004]]. A council-issued Licence to be a landlord of such a unit is always required in some local authorities (in others, limited to the larger statutory examples).\n\n;Residential leasehold\nTenancies above a couple of years are normally called leases and tend to be long; if more than 7 years a new leasehold estate must be registered.<ref>[[LRA 2002]], Sch.3<\/ref> These are governed by few of the above rules and are in longer examples deliberately more akin to full ownership than tenancies, in general.  They seldom require a sizeable [[ground rent]]. The law has not regulated hefty break\/resale charges nor does it prevent the sale of leasehold houses; in the 2010s certain of these proposals have been widely consulted upon and are being drafted.  Broadly, legislation allows such lessees (tenants) to club together to gain the [[Right to Manage]], and the right to buy the landlord's interest (to collectively enfranchise). It allows them individually to extend their leases for a new, smaller sum (\"premium\"), which if the tenants have enfranchised will not normally be demanded\/recommended every 15-35 years.  Notice requirements and forms tend to be strict. In smaller examples the tenant, depending on a simple mathematical division of the building, may be able to enfranchise individually. Statute of 1925 implies into nearly all leases or property that they can be sold (by the lessee, assigned); allowing that some limit this to those the landlord considers reasonable, without delay. \n\nIn the overall diminishing domain of [[social housing]], exceptionally, lessees widely acquire over time the [[Right to Buy]] for a fixed discount on the market price of the home.\n\n;Commercial (business) leases and tenancies\nIn commercial property much of the law, especially as to disputes and basic responsibilities, is based on freedom of contract of the [[common law]] including the implied terms of precedent decisions of wide-ranging case law such as the meaning of \"good and substantial repair\". Implied principles include \"non-derogation from grant\" and \"quiet enjoyment\". All businesses which are tenants (lessees) must decide whether to contract in or outside of Part 2 (i.e. II) the [[Landlord and Tenant Act 1954]] which gives them \"business security of tenure\". If not, it generally applies by default. This \"security of tenure\" is expressly subject to common reasons and associated mechanisms for a landlord to obtain back the premises.  If a landlord is selling a block and a qualifying tenant occupies more than 50%, the tenant should be given the [[right of first refusal]] at the asking price to buy the block. As in most jurisdictions the law on rigorous adherence to lease terms on unlawful subletting and assignment can be strictly enforced, resulting in financial and premises loss if broken. Failure to repay a rent demand, unlike residential, can result in direct landlord's repossession (\"peaceable re-entry\").  The taking of a tenant's good without a court order ([[Distress (law)|distress]]) has been banned.<ref>[http:\/\/researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk\/documents\/SN04103\/SN04103.pdf ''Bailiffs''] Lorraine Conway and Jack Dent.

Anping, Hebei.jpg|thumb|280px|Powerful landlord in chariot. [[Eastern Han]] 25-220 CE. [[Hebei]], China.]]\nA '''landlord''' is the owner of a [[house]], [[apartment]], [[condominium]], land or [[real estate]] which is [[Renting|rent]]ed or [[lease]]d to an individual or business, who is called a [[Leasehold estate|tenant]] (also a ''lessee'' or ''renter'').  When a [[juristic person]] is in this position, the term landlord is used. Other terms include '''lessor''' and '''owner'''. The term '''landlady''' may be used for [[women]] owners, and lessor may be used regardless of [[gender identity]].\n\n==History==\nThe concept of a landlord may be traced back to the [[feudalism|feudal]] system of [[manoralism]] ([[seignorialism]]), where a [[landed estate]] is owned by a [[Lord of the Manor]] ([[mesne lord]]s), usually members of the lower nobility which came to form the rank of [[knight]]s in the high medieval period, holding their fief via [[subinfeudation]], but in some cases the land may also be directly subject to a member of higher nobility, as in the [[royal domain]] directly owned by a king, or in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] [[Imperial Village|imperial villages]] directly subject to the emperor.\nThe medieval system ultimately continues the system of [[Roman villa|villas]] and [[latifundium|latifundia]] (peasant-worked broad farmsteads) of the [[Roman Empire]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http:\/\/faculty.history.wisc.edu\/sommerville\/123\/feudalism.htm|title=Feudalism|author=|date=|website=faculty.history.wisc.edu|accessdate=14 March 2018}}<\/ref>\n\nIn modern times, landlord describes any individual(s) or entity (e.g. government body or institution) providing housing for persons who cannot afford or do not want to own their own homes.  The incentive, certainly if not [[social housing]], is to obtain a good rental yield (annual return on investment) and prospect of property price inflation. The disincentives are the locally varying duties of landlords in repair\/maintenance and administration &mdash; and keynote risks (tenant disputes, damage, neglect, loss of rent, insurance inavailability\/disputes, economic slump, increased rate of interest on any mortgage, and negative equity or loss of investment).  \n\n===Social stigmas of lower-market landlords and tenants in a property-owning culture===\nRenters (tenants or other licensees) at the lowest end of the payment scale may be in social or economic difficulty and due to their address or length of tenure may suffer a [[social stigma]].\n\nA sometimes widely promoted social stigma can impact certain for-profit owners of rental property, especially in troubled neighborhoods.  The term \"slumlord\" \/ \"slum landlord\" is sometimes used to describe landlords in those circumstances.  Public improvement money\/private major economic investment can improve areas and negate the stigma.  In the extreme government [[compulsory purchase]] powers in many countries enable [[slum clearance]] to replace the worst of neighbourhoods.\n\nExamples:\n*In [[Minneapolis]], downmarket landlords vocally and financially opposed a major reform and redevelopment plan of city officials and, in the 2001 election, succeeded in defeating the incumbent mayor and half the city council.<ref> http:\/\/www.landlordpolitics.com\/landlord.html Minneapolis Property Rights Action Committee events & adventures<\/ref> \n\n*[[Peter Rachman]] was a [[landlord]] who operated in [[Notting Hill]], [[London]] in the 1950s and until his 1962 death. He became notorious for exploitation of his [[Leasehold estate|tenants]], with the word \"'''Rachmanism'''\" entering the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''. His henchmen included [[Michael X|Michael de Freitas]] (aka Michael X\/Abdul Malik), who created a reputation as a black-power leader, and [[Johnny Edgecombe]], who became a promoter of jazz and blues, which helped to keep him in the limelight.<ref name=\"Three\">[http:\/\/www.historytalk.org\/Tom%20Vague%20Pop%20History\/Chp%201.pdf ''Getting it Straight in Notting Hill Gate'', Tom Vague, 2007]<\/ref>\n\n==Owner and tenant responsibilities==\nA [[rental agreement]], or ''lease'', is the [[contract]] defining such terms as the price paid, penalties for late payments, the length of the rental or lease, and the amount of notice required before either the homeowner or tenant cancels the agreement.  In general, responsibilities are given as follows: the homeowner is responsible for making repairs and performing property maintenance, and the tenant is responsible for keeping the property clean and safe.\n\nMany owners hire a [[property management]] company to take care of all the details of renting their property out to a tenant. This usually includes advertising the property and showing it to prospective tenants, negotiating and preparing the written leases, and then, once rented, collecting rent from the tenant and performing repairs as needed.\n\n[[Image:E9438-David-Berry-monument.jpg|thumb|Being a good landlord, [[David Berry (landowner)|David Berry]] (who had owned much of what is now known as [[Berry, New South Wales|Berry - the town was named after him]]) is well remembered by his tenants.]]\n\n===United States===\nIn the [[United States]], [[residential]] homeowner\u2013tenant disputes are primarily governed by [[state law]] (not [[federal law]]) regarding [[property]] and [[contracts]].  State law and, in some places, city law or county law, sets the requirements for [[eviction]] of a tenant.  Generally, there are a limited number of reasons for which a landlord or landlady can evict his or her tenant before the expiration of the tenancy, though at the end of the lease term the rental relationship can generally be terminated without giving any reason. Some cities, counties, and States have laws establishing the maximum rent a landlord can charge, known as rent control, or [[rent regulation]], and related [[eviction]]. There is also an [[Implied warranty of habitability#Habitability|implied warranty of habitability]], whereby a landlord must maintain safe, decent and habitable housing, meeting minimum safety requirements such as smoke detectors and a locking door.\n\n===Canada===\nIn [[Canada]],  [[residential]] homeowner\u2013tenant disputes are primarily governed by [[provincial law]] (not [[federal law]]) regarding [[property]] and [[contracts]].  Provincial  law sets the requirements for [[eviction]] of a tenant.  Generally, there are a limited number of reasons for which a landlord  can evict a tenant. Some provinces have laws establishing the maximum rent a landlord can charge, known as rent control, or [[rent regulation]], and related [[eviction]]. There is also an [[Implied warranty of habitability#Habitability|implied warranty of habitability]], whereby a landlord must maintain safe, decent and habitable housing, meeting minimum safety requirements.\n\n===United Kingdom===\n{{See also|English land law#Leases and licences|Scots property law}}\n;Residential rental market (tenancies)\nPrivate sector renting is largely governed by many of the [[Landlord and Tenant Act]]s, in particular the [[Landlord and Tenant Act 1985]] which sets bare minimum standards in tenants' rights against their landlords.  Another key statute is the [[Housing Act 2004]].  Rents can be freely increased at the end of a usual six-month duration, on proper notice given to the tenant. A Possession Order under the most common type, the [[Assured Shorthold Tenancy]] (AST) is usually obtainable after eight weeks\/two months of unpaid rent, and at the court's discretion after serving the tenant with a [[Section 8 notice]] (under the [[Housing Act 1988]] as amended) for a lesser period for all assured tenancies &mdash; and on other grounds which defer to the landlord's ownership of the property.  If the tenancy is an AST then any possession order will not take effect until six months has passed into the initial tenancy.  A tenancy of someone who has been in occupation since before 15 January 1989 usually, if not a shorthold from the outset following their inception from 1980 onwards, may be a \"[[regulated tenancy]]\" with many more rights, especially under the [[Rent Act 1977]] and [[Protection from Eviction Act 1977]], introduced by the [[Third Wilson ministry]].<ref>http:\/\/assets.publishing.service.gov.uk\/government\/uploads\/system\/uploads\/attachment_data\/file\/11445\/138295.pdf<\/ref>\n\nEach [[house in multiple occupation]], a unit the law does not regard it as a single household having more than three tenants, is subject to enhanced regulations including the [[Housing Act 2004]]. A council-issued Licence to be a landlord of such a unit is always required in some local authorities (in others, limited to the larger statutory examples).\n\n;Residential leasehold\nTenancies above a couple of years are normally called leases and tend to be long; if more than 7 years a new leasehold estate must be registered.<ref>[[LRA 2002]], Sch.3<\/ref> These are governed by few of the above rules and are in longer examples deliberately more akin to full ownership than tenancies, in general.  They seldom require a sizeable [[ground rent]]. The law has not regulated hefty break\/resale charges nor does it prevent the sale of leasehold houses; in the 2010s certain of these proposals have been widely consulted upon and are being drafted.  Broadly, legislation allows such lessees (tenants) to club together to gain the [[Right to Manage]], and the right to buy the landlord's interest (to collectively enfranchise). It allows them individually to extend their leases for a new, smaller sum (\"premium\"), which if the tenants have enfranchised will not normally be demanded\/recommended every 15-35 years.  Notice requirements and forms tend to be strict. In smaller examples the tenant, depending on a simple mathematical division of the building, may be able to enfranchise individually. Statute of 1925 implies into nearly all leases (tenancies at low rent and at a premium (fine, initial large sum)) of property that they can be sold (by the lessee, assigned); reducing any restriction to one whereby the landlord may apply standard that is \"reasonable\" vetting, without causing major delay. This is often known as the \"statutory qualified covenant on assignment\/alienation\".\n\nIn the overall diminishing domain of [[social housing]], exceptionally, lessees widely acquire over time the [[Right to Buy]] for a fixed discount on the market price of the home.\n\n;Commercial (business) leases and tenancies\nIn commercial property much of the law, especially as to disputes and basic responsibilities, is based on freedom of contract of the [[common law]] including the implied terms of precedent decisions of wide-ranging case law such as the meaning of \"good and substantial repair\". Implied principles include \"non-derogation from grant\" and \"quiet enjoyment\". All businesses which are tenants (lessees) must decide whether to contract in or outside of Part 2 (i.e. II) the [[Landlord and Tenant Act 1954]] which gives them \"business security of tenure\". If not, it generally applies by default. This \"security of tenure\" is expressly subject to common reasons and associated mechanisms for a landlord to obtain back the premises.  If a landlord is selling a block and a qualifying tenant occupies more than 50%, the tenant should be given the [[right of first refusal]] at the asking price to buy the block. As in most jurisdictions the law on rigorous adherence to lease terms on unlawful subletting and assignment can be strictly enforced, resulting in financial and premises loss if broken. Failure to repay a rent demand, unlike residential, can result in direct landlord's repossession (\"peaceable re-entry\").  The taking of a tenant's good without a court order ([[Distress (law)|distress]]) has been banned.<ref>[http:\/\/researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk\/documents\/SN04103\/SN04103.pdf ''Bailiffs''] Lorraine Conway and Jack Dent.

A landlord can also decide to collect a security deposit or move-in fee which can also be a consideration for the tenant.  Many factors including city\/state regulations can drive the landlord to choose one over the other.\n\n==Licensed victualler==\n{{Main article|Pub}}\n\nIn the [[United Kingdom]], the owner and\/or manager of a pub, or public house, is usually called the \"landlord\/landlady\", and often, strictly incorrectly, \"[[publican]]\", the latter properly the appellation of a Roman public contractor or [[Tax farming|tax farmer]].

Anping, Hebei.jpg|thumb|280px|Powerful landlord in chariot. [[Eastern Han]] 25-220 CE. [[Hebei]], China.]]\nA '''landlord''' is the owner of a [[house]], [[apartment]], [[condominium]], land or [[real estate]] which is [[Renting|rent]]ed or [[lease]]d to an individual or business, who is called a [[Leasehold estate|tenant]] (also a ''lessee'' or ''renter'').  When a [[juristic person]] is in this position, the term landlord is used. Other terms include '''lessor''' and '''owner'''. The term '''landlady''' may be used for [[women]] owners, and lessor may be used regardless of [[gender identity]].\n\n==History==\nThe concept of a landlord may be traced back to the [[feudalism|feudal]] system of [[manoralism]] ([[seignorialism]]), where a [[landed estate]] is owned by a [[Lord of the Manor]] ([[mesne lord]]s), usually members of the lower nobility which came to form the rank of [[knight]]s in the high medieval period, holding their fief via [[subinfeudation]], but in some cases the land may also be directly subject to a member of higher nobility, as in the [[royal domain]] directly owned by a king, or in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] [[Imperial Village|imperial villages]] directly subject to the emperor.\nThe medieval system ultimately continues the system of [[Roman villa|villas]] and [[latifundium|latifundia]] (peasant-worked broad farmsteads) of the [[Roman Empire]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http:\/\/faculty.history.wisc.edu\/sommerville\/123\/feudalism.htm|title=Feudalism|author=|date=|website=faculty.history.wisc.edu|accessdate=14 March 2018}}<\/ref>\n\nIn modern times, landlord describes any individual(s) or entity (e.g. government body or institution) providing housing for persons who cannot afford or do not want to own their own homes.  The incentive, certainly if not [[social housing]], is to obtain a good rental yield (annual return on investment) and prospect of property price inflation. The disincentives are the locally varying duties of landlords in repair\/maintenance and administration &mdash; and keynote risks (tenant disputes, damage, neglect, loss of rent, insurance inavailability\/disputes, economic slump, increased rate of interest on any mortgage, and negative equity or loss of investment).  \n\n===Social stigmas of lower-market landlords and tenants in a property-owning culture===\nRenters (tenants or other licensees) at the lowest end of the payment scale may be in social or economic difficulty and due to their address or length of tenure may suffer a [[social stigma]].\n\nA sometimes widely promoted social stigma can impact certain for-profit owners of rental property, especially in troubled neighborhoods.  The term \"slumlord\" \/ \"slum landlord\" is sometimes used to describe landlords in those circumstances.  Public improvement money\/private major economic investment can improve areas and negate the stigma.  In the extreme government [[compulsory purchase]] powers in many countries enable [[slum clearance]] to replace the worst of neighbourhoods.\n\nExamples:\n*In [[Minneapolis]], downmarket landlords vocally and financially opposed a major reform and redevelopment plan of city officials and, in the 2001 election, succeeded in defeating the incumbent mayor and half the city council.<ref> http:\/\/www.landlordpolitics.com\/landlord.html Minneapolis Property Rights Action Committee events & adventures<\/ref> \n\n*[[Peter Rachman]] was a [[landlord]] who operated in [[Notting Hill]], [[London]] in the 1950s and until his 1962 death. He became notorious for exploitation of his [[Leasehold estate|tenants]], with the word \"'''Rachmanism'''\" entering the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''. His henchmen included [[Michael X|Michael de Freitas]] (aka Michael X\/Abdul Malik), who created a reputation as a black-power leader, and [[Johnny Edgecombe]], who became a promoter of jazz and blues, which helped to keep him in the limelight.<ref name=\"Three\">[http:\/\/www.historytalk.org\/Tom%20Vague%20Pop%20History\/Chp%201.pdf ''Getting it Straight in Notting Hill Gate'', Tom Vague, 2007]<\/ref>\n\n==Owner and tenant responsibilities==\nA [[rental agreement]], or ''lease'', is the [[contract]] defining such terms as the price paid, penalties for late payments, the length of the rental or lease, and the amount of notice required before either the homeowner or tenant cancels the agreement.  In general, responsibilities are given as follows: the homeowner is responsible for making repairs and performing property maintenance, and the tenant is responsible for keeping the property clean and safe.\n\nMany owners hire a [[property management]] company to take care of all the details of renting their property out to a tenant. This usually includes advertising the property and showing it to prospective tenants, negotiating and preparing the written leases, and then, once rented, collecting rent from the tenant and performing repairs as needed.\n\n[[Image:E9438-David-Berry-monument.jpg|thumb|Being a good landlord, [[David Berry (landowner)|David Berry]] (who had owned much of what is now known as [[Berry, New South Wales|Berry - the town was named after him]]) is well remembered by his tenants.]]\n\n===United States===\nIn the [[United States]], [[residential]] homeowner\u2013tenant disputes are primarily governed by [[state law]] (not [[federal law]]) regarding [[property]] and [[contracts]].  State law and, in some places, city law or county law, sets the requirements for [[eviction]] of a tenant.  Generally, there are a limited number of reasons for which a landlord or landlady can evict his or her tenant before the expiration of the tenancy, though at the end of the lease term the rental relationship can generally be terminated without giving any reason. Some cities, counties, and States have laws establishing the maximum rent a landlord can charge, known as rent control, or [[rent regulation]], and related [[eviction]]. There is also an [[Implied warranty of habitability#Habitability|implied warranty of habitability]], whereby a landlord must maintain safe, decent and habitable housing, meeting minimum safety requirements such as smoke detectors and a locking door.\n\n===Canada===\nIn [[Canada]],  [[residential]] homeowner\u2013tenant disputes are primarily governed by [[provincial law]] (not [[federal law]]) regarding [[property]] and [[contracts]].  Provincial  law sets the requirements for [[eviction]] of a tenant.  Generally, there are a limited number of reasons for which a landlord  can evict a tenant. Some provinces have laws establishing the maximum rent a landlord can charge, known as rent control, or [[rent regulation]], and related [[eviction]]. There is also an [[Implied warranty of habitability#Habitability|implied warranty of habitability]], whereby a landlord must maintain safe, decent and habitable housing, meeting minimum safety requirements.\n\n===United Kingdom===\n{{See also|English land law#Leases and licences|Scots property law}}\n;Residential rental market (tenancies)\nPrivate sector renting is largely governed by many of the [[Landlord and Tenant Act]]s, in particular the [[Landlord and Tenant Act 1985]] which sets bare minimum standards in tenants' rights against their landlords.  Another key statute is the [[Housing Act 2004]].  Rents can be freely increased at the end of a usual six-month duration, on proper notice given to the tenant. A Possession Order under the most common type, the [[Assured Shorthold Tenancy]] (AST) is usually obtainable after eight weeks\/two months of unpaid rent, and at the court's discretion after serving the tenant with a [[Section 8 notice]] (under the [[Housing Act 1988]] as amended) for a lesser period for all assured tenancies &mdash; and on other grounds which defer to the landlord's ownership of the property.  If the tenancy is an AST then any possession order will not take effect until six months has passed into the initial tenancy.  A tenancy of someone who has been in occupation since before 15 January 1989 usually, if not a shorthold from the outset following their inception from 1980 onwards, may be a \"[[regulated tenancy]]\" with many more rights, especially under the [[Rent Act 1977]] and [[Protection from Eviction Act 1977]], introduced by the [[Third Wilson ministry]].<ref>http:\/\/assets.publishing.service.gov.uk\/government\/uploads\/system\/uploads\/attachment_data\/file\/11445\/138295.pdf<\/ref>\n\nEach [[house in multiple occupation]], a unit the law does not regard it as a single household having more than three tenants, is subject to enhanced regulations including the [[Housing Act 2004]]. A council-issued Licence to be a landlord of such a unit is always required in some local authorities (in others, limited to the larger statutory examples).\n\n;Residential leasehold\nTenancies above a couple of years are normally called leases and tend to be long; if more than 7 years a new leasehold estate must be registered.<ref>[[LRA 2002]], Sch.3<\/ref> These are governed by few of the above rules and are in longer examples deliberately more akin to full ownership than tenancies, in general.  They seldom require a sizeable [[ground rent]]. The law has not regulated hefty break\/resale charges nor does it prevent the sale of leasehold houses; in the 2010s certain of these proposals have been widely consulted upon and are being drafted.  Broadly, legislation allows such lessees (tenants) to club together to gain the [[Right to Manage]], and the right to buy the landlord's interest (to collectively enfranchise). It allows them individually to extend their leases for a new, smaller sum (\"premium\"), which if the tenants have enfranchised will not normally be demanded\/recommended every 15-35 years.  Notice requirements and forms tend to be strict. In smaller examples the tenant, depending on a simple mathematical division of the building, may be able to enfranchise individually. Statute of 1925 implies into nearly all leases (tenancies at low rent and at a premium (fine, initial large sum)) of property that they can be sold (by the lessee, assigned); reducing any restriction to one whereby the landlord may apply standard that is \"reasonable\" vetting, without causing major delay. This is often known as the \"statutory qualified covenant on assignment\/alienation\".\n\nIn the overall diminishing domain of [[social housing]], exceptionally, lessees widely acquire over time the [[Right to Buy]] for a fixed discount on the market price of the home.\n\n;Commercial (business) leases and tenancies\nIn commercial property much of the law, especially as to disputes and basic responsibilities, is based on freedom of contract of the [[common law]] including the implied terms of precedent decisions of wide-ranging case law such as the meaning of \"good and substantial repair\". Implied principles include \"non-derogation from grant\" and \"quiet enjoyment\". All businesses which are tenants (lessees) must decide whether to contract in or outside of Part 2 (i.e. II) the [[Landlord and Tenant Act 1954]] which gives them \"business security of tenure\". If not, it generally applies by default. This \"security of tenure\" is expressly subject to common reasons and associated mechanisms for a landlord to obtain back the premises.  If a landlord is selling a block and a qualifying tenant occupies more than 50%, the tenant should be given the [[right of first refusal]] at the asking price to buy the block. As in most jurisdictions the law on rigorous adherence to lease terms on unlawful subletting and assignment can be strictly enforced, resulting in financial and premises loss if broken. Failure to repay a rent demand, unlike residential, can result in direct landlord's repossession (\"peaceable re-entry\").  The taking of a tenant's goods without a court-issued warrant (flowing from a court order or outstanding tax demand) ([[Distress (law)|distress]]) has been banned.<ref>[http:\/\/researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk\/documents\/SN04103\/SN04103.pdf ''Bailiffs''] Lorraine Conway and Jack Dent.

Anping, Hebei.jpg|thumb|280px|Powerful landlord in chariot. [[Eastern Han]] 25-220 CE. [[Hebei]], China.]]\nA '''landlord''' is the owner of a [[house]], [[apartment]], [[condominium]], land or [[real estate]] which is [[Renting|rent]]ed or [[lease]]d to an individual or business, who is called a [[Leasehold estate|tenant]] (also a ''lessee'' or ''renter'').  When a [[juristic person]] is in this position, the term landlord is used. Other terms include '''lessor''' and '''owner'''. The term '''landlady''' may be used for [[women]] owners, and lessor may be used regardless of [[gender identity]].\n\n==History==\nThe concept of a landlord may be traced back to the [[feudalism|feudal]] system of [[manoralism]] ([[seignorialism]]), where a [[landed estate]] is owned by a [[Lord of the Manor]] ([[mesne lord]]s), usually members of the lower nobility which came to form the rank of [[knight]]s in the high medieval period, holding their fief via [[subinfeudation]], but in some cases the land may also be directly subject to a member of higher nobility, as in the [[royal domain]] directly owned by a king, or in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] [[Imperial Village|imperial villages]] directly subject to the emperor.\nThe medieval system ultimately continues the system of [[Roman villa|villas]] and [[latifundium|latifundia]] (peasant-worked broad farmsteads) of the [[Roman Empire]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http:\/\/faculty.history.wisc.edu\/sommerville\/123\/feudalism.htm|title=Feudalism|author=|date=|website=faculty.history.wisc.edu|accessdate=14 March 2018}}<\/ref>\n\nIn modern times, landlord describes any individual(s) or entity (e.g. government body or institution) providing housing for persons who cannot afford or do not want to own their own homes. They may be peripatetic, stationed on a secondment away from their home, not want the risk of a mortgage and\/or negative equity, may be a group of co-occupiers unwilling to enter into the ties of co-ownership, or may be improving their credit rating or bank balance to obtain a better-terms future mortgage. \n\n===Social stigmas of lower-market landlords and tenants in a property-owning culture===\nRenters (tenants or other licensees) at the lowest end of the payment scale may be in social or economic difficulty and due to their address or length of tenure may suffer a [[social stigma]].\n\nA sometimes widely promoted social stigma can impact certain for-profit owners of rental property, especially in troubled neighborhoods.  The term \"slumlord\" \/ \"slum landlord\" is sometimes used to describe landlords in those circumstances.  Public improvement money\/private major economic investment can improve areas and negate the stigma.  In the extreme government [[compulsory purchase]] powers in many countries enable [[slum clearance]] to replace the worst of neighbourhoods.\n\nExamples:\n*In [[Minneapolis]], downmarket landlords vocally and financially opposed a major reform and redevelopment plan of city officials and, in the 2001 election, succeeded in defeating the incumbent mayor and half the city council.<ref> http:\/\/www.landlordpolitics.com\/landlord.html Minneapolis Property Rights Action Committee events & adventures<\/ref> \n\n*[[Peter Rachman]] was a [[landlord]] who operated in [[Notting Hill]], [[London]] in the 1950s and until his 1962 death. He became notorious for exploitation of his [[Leasehold estate|tenants]], with the word \"'''Rachmanism'''\" entering the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''. His henchmen included [[Michael X|Michael de Freitas]] (aka Michael X\/Abdul Malik), who created a reputation as a black-power leader, and [[Johnny Edgecombe]], who became a promoter of jazz and blues, which helped to keep him in the limelight.<ref name=\"Three\">[http:\/\/www.historytalk.org\/Tom%20Vague%20Pop%20History\/Chp%201.pdf ''Getting it Straight in Notting Hill Gate'', Tom Vague, 2007]<\/ref>\n\n==Owner and tenant responsibilities==\nA [[rental agreement]], or ''lease'', is the [[contract]] defining such terms as the price paid, penalties for late payments, the length of the rental or lease, and the amount of notice required before either the homeowner or tenant cancels the agreement.  In general, responsibilities are given as follows: the homeowner is responsible for making repairs and performing property maintenance, and the tenant is responsible for keeping the property clean and safe.\n\nMany owners hire a [[property management]] company to take care of all the details of renting their property out to a tenant. This usually includes advertising the property and showing it to prospective tenants, negotiating and preparing the written leases, and then, once rented, collecting rent from the tenant and performing repairs as needed.\n\n[[Image:E9438-David-Berry-monument.jpg|thumb|Being a good landlord, [[David Berry (landowner)|David Berry]] (who had owned much of what is now known as [[Berry, New South Wales|Berry - the town was named after him]]) is well remembered by his tenants.]]\n\n===United States===\nIn the [[United States]], [[residential]] homeowner\u2013tenant disputes are primarily governed by [[state law]] (not [[federal law]]) regarding [[property]] and [[contracts]].  State law and, in some places, city law or county law, sets the requirements for [[eviction]] of a tenant.  Generally, there are a limited number of reasons for which a landlord or landlady can evict his or her tenant before the expiration of the tenancy, though at the end of the lease term the rental relationship can generally be terminated without giving any reason. Some cities, counties, and States have laws establishing the maximum rent a landlord can charge, known as rent control, or [[rent regulation]], and related [[eviction]]. There is also an [[Implied warranty of habitability#Habitability|implied warranty of habitability]], whereby a landlord must maintain safe, decent and habitable housing, meeting minimum safety requirements such as smoke detectors and a locking door.\n\n===Canada===\nIn [[Canada]],  [[residential]] homeowner\u2013tenant disputes are primarily governed by [[provincial law]] (not [[federal law]]) regarding [[property]] and [[contracts]].  Provincial  law sets the requirements for [[eviction]] of a tenant.  Generally, there are a limited number of reasons for which a landlord  can evict a tenant. Some provinces have laws establishing the maximum rent a landlord can charge, known as rent control, or [[rent regulation]], and related [[eviction]]. There is also an [[Implied warranty of habitability#Habitability|implied warranty of habitability]], whereby a landlord must maintain safe, decent and habitable housing, meeting minimum safety requirements.\n\n===United Kingdom===\n{{See also|English land law#Leases and licences|Scots property law}}\n;Residential rental market (tenancies)\nPrivate sector renting is largely governed by many of the [[Landlord and Tenant Act]]s, in particular the [[Landlord and Tenant Act 1985]] which sets bare minimum standards in tenants' rights against their landlords.  Another key statute is the [[Housing Act 2004]].  Rents can be freely increased at the end of a usual six-month duration, on proper notice given to the tenant. A Possession Order under the most common type, the [[Assured Shorthold Tenancy]] (AST) is usually obtainable after eight weeks\/two months of unpaid rent, and at the court's discretion after serving the tenant with a [[Section 8 notice]] (under the [[Housing Act 1988]] as amended) for a lesser period for all assured tenancies &mdash; and on other grounds which defer to the landlord's ownership of the property.  If the tenancy is an AST then any possession order will not take effect until six months has passed into the initial tenancy.  A tenancy of someone who has been in occupation since before 15 January 1989 usually, if not a shorthold from the outset following their inception from 1980 onwards, may be a \"[[regulated tenancy]]\" with many more rights, especially under the [[Rent Act 1977]] and [[Protection from Eviction Act 1977]], introduced by the [[Third Wilson ministry]].<ref>http:\/\/assets.publishing.service.gov.uk\/government\/uploads\/system\/uploads\/attachment_data\/file\/11445\/138295.pdf<\/ref>\n\nEach [[house in multiple occupation]], a unit the law does not regard it as a single household having more than three tenants, is subject to enhanced regulations including the [[Housing Act 2004]]. A council-issued Licence to be a landlord of such a unit is always required in some local authorities (in others, limited to the larger statutory examples).\n\n;Residential leasehold\nTenancies above a couple of years are normally called leases and tend to be long; if more than 7 years a new leasehold estate must be registered.<ref>[[LRA 2002]], Sch.3<\/ref> These are governed by few of the above rules and are in longer examples deliberately more akin to full ownership than tenancies, in general.  They seldom require a sizeable [[ground rent]]. The law has not regulated hefty break\/resale charges nor does it prevent the sale of leasehold houses; in the 2010s certain of these proposals have been widely consulted upon and are being drafted.  Broadly, legislation allows such lessees (tenants) to club together to gain the [[Right to Manage]], and the right to buy the landlord's interest (to collectively enfranchise). It allows them individually to extend their leases for a new, smaller sum (\"premium\"), which if the tenants have enfranchised will not normally be demanded\/recommended every 15-35 years.  Notice requirements and forms tend to be strict. In smaller examples the tenant, depending on a simple mathematical division of the building, may be able to enfranchise individually. Statute of 1925 implies into nearly all leases (tenancies at low rent and at a premium (fine, initial large sum)) of property that they can be sold (by the lessee, assigned); reducing any restriction to one whereby the landlord may apply standard that is \"reasonable\" vetting, without causing major delay. This is often known as the \"statutory qualified covenant on assignment\/alienation\".\n\nIn the overall diminishing domain of [[social housing]], exceptionally, lessees widely acquire over time the [[Right to Buy]] for a fixed discount on the market price of the home.\n\n;Commercial (business) leases and tenancies\nIn commercial property much of the law, especially as to disputes and basic responsibilities, is based on freedom of contract of the [[common law]] including the implied terms of precedent decisions of wide-ranging case law such as the meaning of \"good and substantial repair\". Implied principles include \"non-derogation from grant\" and \"quiet enjoyment\". All businesses which are tenants (lessees) must decide whether to contract in or outside of Part 2 (i.e. II) the [[Landlord and Tenant Act 1954]] which gives them \"business security of tenure\". If not, it generally applies by default. This \"security of tenure\" is expressly subject to common reasons and associated mechanisms for a landlord to obtain back the premises.  If a landlord is selling a block and a qualifying tenant occupies more than 50%, the tenant should be given the [[right of first refusal]] at the asking price to buy the block. As in most jurisdictions the law on rigorous adherence to lease terms on unlawful subletting and assignment can be strictly enforced, resulting in financial and premises loss if broken. Failure to repay a rent demand, unlike residential, can result in direct landlord's repossession (\"peaceable re-entry\").  The taking of a tenant's goods without a court-issued warrant (flowing from a court order or outstanding tax demand) ([[Distress (law)|distress]]) has been banned.<ref>[http:\/\/researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk\/documents\/SN04103\/SN04103.pdf ''Bailiffs''] Lorraine Conway and Jack Dent.

Anping, Hebei.jpg|thumb|280px|Powerful landlord in chariot. [[Eastern Han]] 25-220 CE. [[Hebei]], China.]]\nA '''landlord''' is the owner of a [[house]], [[apartment]], [[condominium]], land or [[real estate]] which is [[Renting|rent]]ed or [[lease]]d to an individual or business, who is called a [[Leasehold estate|tenant]] (also a ''lessee'' or ''renter'').  When a [[juristic person]] is in this position, the term landlord is used. Other terms include '''lessor''' and '''owner'''. The term '''landlady''' may be used for [[women]] owners, and lessor may be used regardless of [[gender identity]].\n\n==History==\nThe concept of a landlord may be traced back to the [[feudalism|feudal]] system of [[manoralism]] ([[seignorialism]]), where a [[landed estate]] is owned by a [[Lord of the Manor]] ([[mesne lord]]s), usually members of the lower nobility which came to form the rank of [[knight]]s in the high medieval period, holding their fief via [[subinfeudation]], but in some cases the land may also be directly subject to a member of higher nobility, as in the [[royal domain]] directly owned by a king, or in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] [[Imperial Village|imperial villages]] directly subject to the emperor.\nThe medieval system ultimately continues the system of [[Roman villa|villas]] and [[latifundium|latifundia]] (peasant-worked broad farmsteads) of the [[Roman Empire]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http:\/\/faculty.history.wisc.edu\/sommerville\/123\/feudalism.htm|title=Feudalism|author=|date=|website=faculty.history.wisc.edu|accessdate=14 March 2018}}<\/ref>\n\nIn modern times, landlord describes any individual(s) or entity (e.g. government body or institution) providing housing for persons who cannot afford or do not want to own their own homes. They may be peripatetic, stationed on a secondment away from their home, not want the risk of a mortgage and\/or negative equity, may be a group of co-occupiers unwilling to enter into the ties of co-ownership, or may be improving their credit rating or bank balance to obtain a better-terms future mortgage. \n\n===Social stigmas of lower-market landlords and tenants in a property-owning culture===\nRenters (tenants or other licensees) at the lowest end of the payment scale may be in social or economic difficulty and due to their address or length of tenure may suffer a [[social stigma]].\n\nA sometimes widely promoted social stigma can impact certain for-profit owners of rental property, especially in troubled neighborhoods.  The term \"slumlord\" \/ \"slum landlord\" is sometimes used to describe landlords in those circumstances.  Public improvement money\/private major economic investment can improve areas and negate the stigma.  In the extreme government [[compulsory purchase]] powers in many countries enable [[slum clearance]] to replace the worst of neighbourhoods.\n\nExamples:\n*In [[Minneapolis]], downmarket landlords vocally and financially opposed a major reform and redevelopment plan of city officials and, in the 2001 election, succeeded in defeating the incumbent mayor and half the city council.<ref> http:\/\/www.landlordpolitics.com\/landlord.html Minneapolis Property Rights Action Committee events & adventures<\/ref> \n\n*[[Peter Rachman]] was a [[landlord]] who operated in [[Notting Hill]], [[London]] in the 1950s and until his 1962 death. He became notorious for exploitation of his [[Leasehold estate|tenants]], with the word \"'''Rachmanism'''\" entering the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''. His henchmen included [[Michael X|Michael de Freitas]] (aka Michael X\/Abdul Malik), who created a reputation as a black-power leader, and [[Johnny Edgecombe]], who became a promoter of jazz and blues, which helped to keep him in the limelight.<ref name=\"Three\">[http:\/\/www.historytalk.org\/Tom%20Vague%20Pop%20History\/Chp%201.pdf ''Getting it Straight in Notting Hill Gate'', Tom Vague, 2007]<\/ref>\n\n==Owner and tenant responsibilities==\nA [[rental agreement]], or ''lease'', is the [[contract]] defining such terms as the price paid, penalties for late payments, the length of the rental or lease, and the amount of notice required before either the homeowner or tenant cancels the agreement.  In general, responsibilities are given as follows: the homeowner is responsible for making repairs and performing property maintenance, and the tenant is responsible for keeping the property clean and safe.\n\nMany owners hire a [[property management]] company to take care of all the details of renting their property out to a tenant. This usually includes advertising the property and showing it to prospective tenants, negotiating and preparing the written leases, and then, once rented, collecting rent from the tenant and performing repairs as needed.\n\n[[Image:E9438-David-Berry-monument.jpg|thumb|Being a good landlord, [[David Berry (landowner)|David Berry]] (who had owned much of what is now known as [[Berry, New South Wales|Berry - the town was named after him]]) is well remembered by his tenants.]]\n\n===United States===\nIn the [[United States]], [[residential]] homeowner\u2013tenant disputes are primarily governed by [[state law]] (not [[federal law]]) regarding [[property]] and [[contracts]].  State law and, in some places, city law or county law, sets the requirements for [[eviction]] of a tenant.  Generally, there are a limited number of reasons for which a landlord or landlady can evict his or her tenant before the expiration of the tenancy, though at the end of the lease term the rental relationship can generally be terminated without giving any reason. Some cities, counties, and States have laws establishing the maximum rent a landlord can charge, known as rent control, or [[rent regulation]], and related [[eviction]]. There is also an [[Implied warranty of habitability#Habitability|implied warranty of habitability]], whereby a landlord must maintain safe, decent and habitable housing, meeting minimum safety requirements such as smoke detectors and a locking door.\n\n===Canada===\nIn [[Canada]],  [[residential]] homeowner\u2013tenant disputes are primarily governed by [[provincial law]] (not [[federal law]]) regarding [[property]] and [[contracts]].  Provincial  law sets the requirements for [[eviction]] of a tenant.  Generally, there are a limited number of reasons for which a landlord  can evict a tenant. Some provinces have laws establishing the maximum rent a landlord can charge, known as rent control, or [[rent regulation]], and related [[eviction]]. There is also an [[Implied warranty of habitability#Habitability|implied warranty of habitability]], whereby a landlord must maintain safe, decent and habitable housing, meeting minimum safety requirements.\n\n===United Kingdom===\n{{See also|English land law#Leases and licences|Scots property law}}\n;Residential rental market (tenancies)\nPrivate sector renting is largely governed by many of the [[Landlord and Tenant Act]]s, in particular the [[Landlord and Tenant Act 1985]] which sets bare minimum standards in tenants' rights against their landlords.  Another key statute is the [[Housing Act 2004]].  Rents can be freely increased at the end of a usual six-month duration, on proper notice given to the tenant. A Possession Order under the most common type, the [[Assured Shorthold Tenancy]] (AST) is usually obtainable after eight weeks\/two months of unpaid rent, and at the court's discretion after serving the tenant with a [[Section 8 notice]] (under the [[Housing Act 1988]] as amended) for a lesser period for all assured tenancies &mdash; and on other grounds which defer to the landlord's ownership of the property.  If the tenancy is an AST then any possession order will not take effect until six months has passed into the initial tenancy.  A tenancy of someone who has been in occupation since before 15 January 1989 usually, if not a shorthold from the outset following their inception from 1980 onwards, may be a \"[[regulated tenancy]]\" with many more rights, especially under the [[Rent Act 1977]] and [[Protection from Eviction Act 1977]], introduced by the [[Third Wilson ministry]].<ref>http:\/\/assets.publishing.service.gov.uk\/government\/uploads\/system\/uploads\/attachment_data\/file\/11445\/138295.pdf<\/ref>\n\nEach [[house in multiple occupation]], a unit the law does not regard it as a single household having more than three tenants, is subject to enhanced regulations including the [[Housing Act 2004]]. A council-issued Licence to be a landlord of such a unit is always required in some local authorities (in others, limited to the larger statutory examples).\n\n;Residential leasehold\nTenancies above a couple of years are normally called leases and tend to be long; if more than 7 years a new leasehold estate must be registered.<ref>[[LRA 2002]], Sch.3<\/ref> These are governed by few of the above rules and are in longer examples deliberately more akin to full ownership than tenancies, in general.  They seldom require a sizeable [[ground rent]]. The law has not regulated hefty break\/resale charges nor does it prevent the sale of leasehold houses; in the 2010s certain of these proposals have been widely consulted upon and are being drafted.  Broadly, legislation allows such lessees (tenants) to club together to gain the [[Right to Manage]], and the right to buy the landlord's interest (to collectively enfranchise). It allows them individually to extend their leases for a new, smaller sum (\"premium\"), which if the tenants have enfranchised will not normally be demanded\/recommended every 15-35 years.  Notice requirements and forms tend to be strict. In smaller examples the tenant, depending on a simple mathematical division of the building, may be able to enfranchise individually. Statute of 1925 implies into nearly all leases (tenancies at low rent and at a premium (fine, initial large sum)) of property that they can be sold (by the lessee, assigned); reducing any restriction to one whereby the landlord may apply standard that is \"reasonable\" vetting, without causing major delay. This is often known as the \"statutory qualified covenant on assignment\/alienation\".\n\nIn the overall diminishing domain of [[social housing]], exceptionally, lessees widely acquire over time the [[Right to Buy]] for a fixed discount on the market price of the home.\n\n;Commercial (business) leases and tenancies\nIn commercial property much of the law, especially as to disputes and basic responsibilities, is based on freedom of contract of the [[common law]] including the implied terms of precedent decisions of wide-ranging case law such as the meaning of \"good and substantial repair\". Implied principles include \"non-derogation from grant\" and \"quiet enjoyment\". All businesses which are tenants (lessees) must decide whether to contract in or outside of Part 2 (i.e. II) the [[Landlord and Tenant Act 1954]] which gives them \"business security of tenure\". If not, it generally applies by default. This \"security of tenure\" is expressly subject to common reasons and associated mechanisms for a landlord to obtain back the premises.  If a landlord is selling a block and a qualifying tenant occupies more than 50%, the tenant should be given the [[right of first refusal]] at the asking price to buy the block. As in most jurisdictions the law on rigorous adherence to lease terms on unlawful subletting and assignment can be strictly enforced, resulting in financial and premises loss if broken. Failure to repay a rent demand, unlike residential, can result in direct landlord's repossession (\"peaceable re-entry\").  The taking of a tenant's goods without a court-issued warrant (flowing from a court order or outstanding tax demand) ([[Distress (law)|distress]]) has been banned.<ref>[http:\/\/researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk\/documents\/SN04103\/SN04103.pdf ''Bailiffs''] Lorraine Conway and Jack Dent.

The disincentives are the locally varying duties of landlords in repair\/maintenance and administration &mdash; and keynote risks (tenant disputes, damage, neglect, loss of rent, insurance inavailability\/disputes, economic slump, increased rate of interest on any mortgage, and negative equity or loss of investment).  Net income (yield) and capital growth from [[letting]] (renting out) particularly in leveraged [[buy to let]], is subject to [[Idiosyncrasy#Idiosyncrasy in economics|idiosyncratic risk]], which is considered objectively intensified for a highly [[leveraging|leveraged]] investor limited to a small number of similar profile homes, of narrow rental market appeal in areas lacking economic resilience.<ref name=NYT032913>{{cite news|title=Rental Investment May Seem Safer Than It Really Is|url=https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2013\/03\/30\/your-money\/investing-in-a-rental-home-isnt-as-safe-as-it-may-seem.html|accessdate=March 30, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 29, 2013|author=Tara Siegel Barnard}}<\/ref>\n\n;Basis\nRental properties can be paid for by the tenant on whatever basis agreed between the landlord and the tenant &mdash; more frequently than weekly or less than yearly is almost unheard of &mdash; and which is always included in the lease agreement (preferably for both sides in writing). It should be one of the factors that a tenant considers before moving in  A landlord or its agent can also decide to collect a security deposit (and\/or in some jurisdictions such as parts of the US, a move-in\/administration fee) which can also be a consideration for the tenant; factors including city\/state regulations can drive the landlord to choose one over the other.\n\n==Licensed victualler==\n{{Main article|Pub}}\n\nIn the [[United Kingdom]], the owner and\/or manager of a pub, or public house, is usually called the \"landlord\/landlady\", and often, strictly incorrectly, \"[[publican]]\", the latter properly the appellation of a Roman public contractor or [[Tax farming|tax farmer]]. In a more formal situations, the term used is '''licensed victualler''' or simply \"licensee\".<ref name='Dictionary.com'>{{cite web|url=http:\/\/dictionary.reference.com\/browse\/victualler |title= Dictionary.com |accessdate=2008-07-19 }}<\/ref> A female landlord can either be called a ''landlady'' or simply landlord.\n\nThe [[Licensed Trade Charity]], formed in 2004 from the merger of the Society of Licensed Victuallers and Licensed Victualler's National Homes,<ref>{{EW charity|230011|Society of Licensed Victuallers}}<\/ref> exists to serve the retirement needs of Britain's pub landlords. The charity also runs three private schools in [[Ascot, Berkshire|Ascot]] and [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]] in [[Berkshire]] and [[Sayers Common]] in [[Sussex]]. As well as having normal full fee paying students, [[Licensed Victuallers' School]] in Ascot provides discounted education prices for the children of landlords and others in the catering industry.\n\n==Landlord associations in Australia==\n\nThere are significant associations of  landlords in [[Australia]].

Anping, Hebei.jpg|thumb|280px|Powerful landlord in chariot. [[Eastern Han]] 25-220 CE. [[Hebei]], China.]]\nA '''landlord''' is the owner of a [[house]], [[apartment]], [[condominium]], land or [[real estate]] which is [[Renting|rent]]ed or [[lease]]d to an individual or business, who is called a [[Leasehold estate|tenant]] (also a ''lessee'' or ''renter'').  When a [[juristic person]] is in this position, the term landlord is used. Other terms include '''lessor''' and '''owner'''. The term '''landlady''' may be used for [[women]] owners, and lessor may be used regardless of [[gender identity]].\n\n==History==\nThe concept of a landlord may be traced back to the [[feudalism|feudal]] system of [[manoralism]] ([[seignorialism]]), where a [[landed estate]] is owned by a [[Lord of the Manor]] ([[mesne lord]]s), usually members of the lower nobility which came to form the rank of [[knight]]s in the high medieval period, holding their fief via [[subinfeudation]], but in some cases the land may also be directly subject to a member of higher nobility, as in the [[royal domain]] directly owned by a king, or in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] [[Imperial Village|imperial villages]] directly subject to the emperor.\nThe medieval system ultimately continues the system of [[Roman villa|villas]] and [[latifundium|latifundia]] (peasant-worked broad farmsteads) of the [[Roman Empire]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http:\/\/faculty.history.wisc.edu\/sommerville\/123\/feudalism.htm|title=Feudalism|author=|date=|website=faculty.history.wisc.edu|accessdate=14 March 2018}}<\/ref>\n\nIn modern times, landlord describes any individual(s) or entity (e.g. government body or institution) providing housing for persons who cannot afford or do not want to own their own homes. They may be peripatetic, stationed on a secondment away from their home, not want the risk of a mortgage and\/or negative equity, may be a group of co-occupiers unwilling to enter into the ties of co-ownership, or may be improving their credit rating or bank balance to obtain a better-terms future mortgage. \n\n===Social stigmas of lower-market landlords and tenants in a property-owning culture===\nRenters (tenants or other licensees) at the lowest end of the payment scale may be in social or economic difficulty and due to their address or length of tenure may suffer a [[social stigma]].\n\nA sometimes widely promoted social stigma can impact certain for-profit owners of rental property, especially in troubled neighborhoods.  The term \"slumlord\" \/ \"slum landlord\" is sometimes used to describe landlords in those circumstances.  Public improvement money\/private major economic investment can improve areas and negate the stigma.  In the extreme government [[compulsory purchase]] powers in many countries enable [[slum clearance]] to replace the worst of neighbourhoods.\n\nExamples:\n*In [[Minneapolis]], downmarket landlords vocally and financially opposed a major reform and redevelopment plan of city officials and, in the 2001 election, succeeded in defeating the incumbent mayor and half the city council.<ref> http:\/\/www.landlordpolitics.com\/landlord.html Minneapolis Property Rights Action Committee events & adventures<\/ref> \n\n*[[Peter Rachman]] was a [[landlord]] who operated in [[Notting Hill]], [[London]] in the 1950s and until his 1962 death. He became notorious for exploitation of his [[Leasehold estate|tenants]], with the word \"'''Rachmanism'''\" entering the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''. His henchmen included [[Michael X|Michael de Freitas]] (aka Michael X\/Abdul Malik), who created a reputation as a black-power leader, and [[Johnny Edgecombe]], who became a promoter of jazz and blues, which helped to keep him in the limelight.<ref name=\"Three\">[http:\/\/www.historytalk.org\/Tom%20Vague%20Pop%20History\/Chp%201.pdf ''Getting it Straight in Notting Hill Gate'', Tom Vague, 2007]<\/ref>\n\n==Owner and tenant responsibilities==\nA [[rental agreement]], or ''lease'', is the [[contract]] defining such terms as the price paid, penalties for late payments, the length of the rental or lease, and the amount of notice required before either the homeowner or tenant cancels the agreement.  In general, responsibilities are given as follows: the homeowner is responsible for making repairs and performing property maintenance, and the tenant is responsible for keeping the property clean and safe.\n\nMany owners hire a [[property management]] company to take care of all the details of renting their property out to a tenant. This usually includes advertising the property and showing it to prospective tenants, negotiating and preparing the written leases, and then, once rented, collecting rent from the tenant and performing repairs as needed.\n\n[[Image:E9438-David-Berry-monument.jpg|thumb|Being a good landlord, [[David Berry (landowner)|David Berry]] (who had owned much of what is now known as [[Berry, New South Wales|Berry - the town was named after him]]) is well remembered by his tenants.]]\n\n===United States===\nIn the [[United States]], [[residential]] homeowner\u2013tenant disputes are primarily governed by [[state law]] (not [[federal law]]) regarding [[property]] and [[contracts]].  State law and, in some places, city law or county law, sets the requirements for [[eviction]] of a tenant.  Generally, there are a limited number of reasons for which a landlord or landlady can evict his or her tenant before the expiration of the tenancy, though at the end of the lease term the rental relationship can generally be terminated without giving any reason. Some cities, counties, and States have laws establishing the maximum rent a landlord can charge, known as rent control, or [[rent regulation]], and related [[eviction]]. There is also an [[Implied warranty of habitability#Habitability|implied warranty of habitability]], whereby a landlord must maintain safe, decent and habitable housing, meeting minimum safety requirements such as smoke detectors and a locking door.\n\n===Canada===\nIn [[Canada]],  [[residential]] homeowner\u2013tenant disputes are primarily governed by [[provincial law]] (not [[federal law]]) regarding [[property]] and [[contracts]].  Provincial  law sets the requirements for [[eviction]] of a tenant.  Generally, there are a limited number of reasons for which a landlord  can evict a tenant. Some provinces have laws establishing the maximum rent a landlord can charge, known as rent control, or [[rent regulation]], and related [[eviction]]. There is also an [[Implied warranty of habitability#Habitability|implied warranty of habitability]], whereby a landlord must maintain safe, decent and habitable housing, meeting minimum safety requirements.\n\n===United Kingdom===\n{{See also|English land law#Leases and licences|Scots property law}}\n;Residential rental market (tenancies)\nPrivate sector renting is largely governed by many of the [[Landlord and Tenant Act]]s, in particular the [[Landlord and Tenant Act 1985]] which sets bare minimum standards in tenants' rights against their landlords.  Another key statute is the [[Housing Act 2004]].  Rents can be freely increased at the end of a usual six-month duration, on proper notice given to the tenant. A Possession Order under the most common type, the [[Assured Shorthold Tenancy]] (AST) is usually obtainable after eight weeks\/two months of unpaid rent, and at the court's discretion after serving the tenant with a [[Section 8 notice]] (under the [[Housing Act 1988]] as amended) for a lesser period for all assured tenancies &mdash; and on other grounds which defer to the landlord's ownership of the property.  If the tenancy is an AST then any possession order will not take effect until six months has passed into the initial tenancy.  A tenancy of someone who has been in occupation since before 15 January 1989 usually, if not a shorthold from the outset following their inception from 1980 onwards, may be a \"[[regulated tenancy]]\" with many more rights, especially under the [[Rent Act 1977]] and [[Protection from Eviction Act 1977]], introduced by the [[Third Wilson ministry]].<ref>http:\/\/assets.publishing.service.gov.uk\/government\/uploads\/system\/uploads\/attachment_data\/file\/11445\/138295.pdf<\/ref>\n\nEach [[house in multiple occupation]], a unit the law does not regard it as a single household having more than three tenants, is subject to enhanced regulations including the [[Housing Act 2004]]. A council-issued Licence to be a landlord of such a unit is always required in some local authorities (in others, limited to the larger statutory examples).\n\n;Residential leasehold\nTenancies above a couple of years are normally called leases and tend to be long; if more than 7 years a new leasehold estate must be registered.<ref>[[LRA 2002]], Sch.3<\/ref> These are governed by few of the above rules and are in longer examples deliberately more akin to full ownership than tenancies, in general.  They seldom require a sizeable [[ground rent]]. The law has not regulated hefty break\/resale charges nor does it prevent the sale of leasehold houses; in the 2010s certain of these proposals have been widely consulted upon and are being drafted.  Broadly, legislation allows such lessees (tenants) to club together to gain the [[Right to Manage]], and the right to buy the landlord's interest (to collectively enfranchise). It allows them individually to extend their leases for a new, smaller sum (\"premium\"), which if the tenants have enfranchised will not normally be demanded\/recommended every 15-35 years.  Notice requirements and forms tend to be strict. In smaller examples the tenant, depending on a simple mathematical division of the building, may be able to enfranchise individually. Statute of 1925 implies into nearly all leases (tenancies at low rent and at a premium (fine, initial large sum)) of property that they can be sold (by the lessee, assigned); reducing any restriction to one whereby the landlord may apply standard that is \"reasonable\" vetting, without causing major delay. This is often known as the \"statutory qualified covenant on assignment\/alienation\".\n\nIn the overall diminishing domain of [[social housing]], exceptionally, lessees widely acquire over time the [[Right to Buy]] for a fixed discount on the market price of the home.\n\n;Commercial (business) leases and tenancies\nIn commercial property much of the law, especially as to disputes and basic responsibilities, is based on freedom of contract of the [[common law]] including the implied terms of precedent decisions of wide-ranging case law such as the meaning of \"good and substantial repair\". Implied principles include \"non-derogation from grant\" and \"quiet enjoyment\". All businesses which are tenants (lessees) must decide whether to contract in or outside of Part 2 (i.e. II) the [[Landlord and Tenant Act 1954]] which gives them \"business security of tenure\". If not, it generally applies by default. This \"security of tenure\" is expressly subject to common reasons and associated mechanisms for a landlord to obtain back the premises.  If a landlord is selling a block and a qualifying tenant occupies more than 50%, the tenant should be given the [[right of first refusal]] at the asking price to buy the block. As in most jurisdictions the law on rigorous adherence to lease terms on unlawful subletting and assignment can be strictly enforced, resulting in financial and premises loss if broken. Failure to repay a rent demand, unlike residential, can result in direct landlord's repossession (\"peaceable re-entry\").  The taking of a tenant's goods without a court-issued warrant (flowing from a court order or outstanding tax demand) ([[Distress (law)|distress]]) has been banned.<ref>[http:\/\/researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk\/documents\/SN04103\/SN04103.pdf ''Bailiffs''] Lorraine Conway and Jack Dent.

Anping, Hebei.jpg|thumb|280px|Powerful landlord in chariot. [[Eastern Han]] 25-220 CE. [[Hebei]], China.]]\nA '''landlord''' is the owner of a [[house]], [[apartment]], [[condominium]], land or [[real estate]] which is [[Renting|rent]]ed or [[lease]]d to an individual or business, who is called a [[Leasehold estate|tenant]] (also a ''lessee'' or ''renter'').  When a [[juristic person]] is in this position, the term landlord is used. Other terms include '''lessor''' and '''owner'''. The term '''landlady''' may be used for [[women]] owners, and lessor may be used regardless of [[gender identity]].\n\n==History==\nThe concept of a landlord may be traced back to the [[feudalism|feudal]] system of [[manoralism]] ([[seignorialism]]), where a [[landed estate]] is owned by a [[Lord of the Manor]] ([[mesne lord]]s), usually members of the lower nobility which came to form the rank of [[knight]]s in the high medieval period, holding their fief via [[subinfeudation]], but in some cases the land may also be directly subject to a member of higher nobility, as in the [[royal domain]] directly owned by a king, or in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] [[Imperial Village|imperial villages]] directly subject to the emperor.\nThe medieval system ultimately continues the system of [[Roman villa|villas]] and [[latifundium|latifundia]] (peasant-worked broad farmsteads) of the [[Roman Empire]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http:\/\/faculty.history.wisc.edu\/sommerville\/123\/feudalism.htm|title=Feudalism|author=|date=|website=faculty.history.wisc.edu|accessdate=14 March 2018}}<\/ref>\n\nIn modern times, landlord describes any individual(s) or entity (e.g. government body or institution) providing housing for persons who cannot afford or do not want to own their own homes. They may be peripatetic, stationed on a secondment away from their home, not want the risk of a mortgage and\/or negative equity, may be a group of co-occupiers unwilling to enter into the ties of co-ownership, or may be improving their credit rating or bank balance to obtain a better-terms future mortgage. \n\n===Social stigmas of lower-market landlords and tenants in a property-owning culture===\nRenters (tenants or other licensees) at the lowest end of the payment scale may be in social or economic difficulty and due to their address or length of tenure may suffer a [[social stigma]].\n\nA sometimes widely promoted social stigma can impact certain for-profit owners of rental property, especially in troubled neighborhoods.  The term \"slumlord\" \/ \"slum landlord\" is sometimes used to describe landlords in those circumstances.  Public improvement money\/private major economic investment can improve areas and negate the stigma.  In the extreme government [[compulsory purchase]] powers in many countries enable [[slum clearance]] to replace the worst of neighbourhoods.\n\nExamples:\n*In [[Minneapolis]], downmarket landlords vocally and financially opposed a major reform and redevelopment plan of city officials and, in the 2001 election, succeeded in defeating the incumbent mayor and half the city council.<ref> http:\/\/www.landlordpolitics.com\/landlord.html Minneapolis Property Rights Action Committee events & adventures<\/ref> \n\n*[[Peter Rachman]] was a [[landlord]] who operated in [[Notting Hill]], [[London]] in the 1950s and until his 1962 death. He became notorious for exploitation of his [[Leasehold estate|tenants]], with the word \"'''Rachmanism'''\" entering the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''. His henchmen included [[Michael X|Michael de Freitas]] (aka Michael X\/Abdul Malik), who created a reputation as a black-power leader, and [[Johnny Edgecombe]], who became a promoter of jazz and blues, which helped to keep him in the limelight.<ref name=\"Three\">[http:\/\/www.historytalk.org\/Tom%20Vague%20Pop%20History\/Chp%201.pdf ''Getting it Straight in Notting Hill Gate'', Tom Vague, 2007]<\/ref>\n\n==Owner and tenant responsibilities==\nA [[rental agreement]], or ''lease'', is the [[contract]] defining such terms as the price paid, penalties for late payments, the length of the rental or lease, and the amount of notice required before either the homeowner or tenant cancels the agreement.  In general, responsibilities are given as follows: the homeowner is responsible for making repairs and performing property maintenance, and the tenant is responsible for keeping the property clean and safe.\n\nMany owners hire a [[property management]] company to take care of all the details of renting their property out to a tenant. This usually includes advertising the property and showing it to prospective tenants, negotiating and preparing the written leases, and then, once rented, collecting rent from the tenant and performing repairs as needed.\n\n[[Image:E9438-David-Berry-monument.jpg|thumb|Being a good landlord, [[David Berry (landowner)|David Berry]] (who had owned much of what is now known as [[Berry, New South Wales|Berry - the town was named after him]]) is well remembered by his tenants.]]\n\n===United States===\nIn the [[United States]], [[residential]] homeowner\u2013tenant disputes are primarily governed by [[state law]] (not [[federal law]]) regarding [[property]] and [[contracts]].

Anping, Hebei.jpg|thumb|280px|Powerful landlord in chariot. [[Eastern Han]] 25-220 CE. [[Hebei]], China.]]\nA '''landlord''' is the owner of a [[house]], [[apartment]], [[condominium]], land or [[real estate]] which is [[Renting|rent]]ed or [[lease]]d to an individual or business, who is called a [[Leasehold estate|tenant]] (also a ''lessee'' or ''renter'').  When a [[juristic person]] is in this position, the term landlord is used. Other terms include '''lessor''' and '''owner'''. The term '''landlady''' may be used for [[women]] owners, and lessor may be used regardless of [[gender identity]].\n\n==History==\nThe concept of a landlord may be traced back to the [[feudalism|feudal]] system of [[manoralism]] ([[seignorialism]]), where a [[landed estate]] is owned by a [[Lord of the Manor]] ([[mesne lord]]s), usually members of the lower nobility which came to form the rank of [[knight]]s in the high medieval period, holding their fief via [[subinfeudation]], but in some cases the land may also be directly subject to a member of higher nobility, as in the [[royal domain]] directly owned by a king, or in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] [[Imperial Village|imperial villages]] directly subject to the emperor.\nThe medieval system ultimately continues the system of [[Roman villa|villas]] and [[latifundium|latifundia]] (peasant-worked broad farmsteads) of the [[Roman Empire]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http:\/\/faculty.history.wisc.edu\/sommerville\/123\/feudalism.htm|title=Feudalism|author=|date=|website=faculty.history.wisc.edu|accessdate=14 March 2018}}<\/ref>\n\nIn modern times, landlord describes any individual(s) or entity (e.g. government body or institution) providing housing for persons who cannot afford or do not want to own their own homes. They may be peripatetic, stationed on a secondment away from their home, not want the risk of a mortgage and\/or negative equity, may be a group of co-occupiers unwilling to enter into the ties of co-ownership, or may be improving their credit rating or bank balance to obtain a better-terms future mortgage. \n\n===Social stigmas of lower-market landlords and tenants in a property-owning culture===\nRenters (tenants or other licensees) at the lowest end of the payment scale may be in social or economic difficulty and due to their address or length of tenure may suffer a [[social stigma]].\n\nA sometimes widely promoted social stigma can impact certain for-profit owners of rental property, especially in troubled neighborhoods.  The term \"slumlord\" \/ \"slum landlord\" is sometimes used to describe landlords in those circumstances.  Public improvement money\/private major economic investment can improve areas and negate the stigma.  In the extreme government [[compulsory purchase]] powers in many countries enable [[slum clearance]] to replace the worst of neighbourhoods.\n\nExamples:\n*In [[Minneapolis]], downmarket landlords vocally and financially opposed a major reform and redevelopment plan of city officials and, in the 2001 election, succeeded in defeating the incumbent mayor and half the city council.<ref> http:\/\/www.landlordpolitics.com\/landlord.html Minneapolis Property Rights Action Committee events & adventures<\/ref> \n\n*[[Peter Rachman]] was a [[landlord]] who operated in [[Notting Hill]], [[London]] in the 1950s and until his 1962 death. He became notorious for exploitation of his [[Leasehold estate|tenants]], with the word \"'''Rachmanism'''\" entering the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''. His henchmen included [[Michael X|Michael de Freitas]] (aka Michael X\/Abdul Malik), who created a reputation as a black-power leader, and [[Johnny Edgecombe]], who became a promoter of jazz and blues, which helped to keep him in the limelight.<ref name=\"Three\">{{cite web|url=http:\/\/www.historytalk.org\/Tom+Vague+Pop+History\/Chp+1.pdf|title=\u2013 historytalk.org|author=|date=|website=www.historytalk.org}}<\/ref>\n\n==Owner and tenant responsibilities==\nA [[rental agreement]], or ''lease'', is the [[contract]] defining such terms as the price paid, penalties for late payments, the length of the rental or lease, and the amount of notice required before either the homeowner or tenant cancels the agreement.  In general, responsibilities are given as follows: the homeowner is responsible for making repairs and performing property maintenance, and the tenant is responsible for keeping the property clean and safe.\n\nMany owners hire a [[property management]] company to take care of all the details of renting their property out to a tenant. This usually includes advertising the property and showing it to prospective tenants, negotiating and preparing the written leases, and then, once rented, collecting rent from the tenant and performing repairs as needed.\n\n[[Image:E9438-David-Berry-monument.jpg|thumb|Being a good landlord, [[David Berry (landowner)|David Berry]] (who had owned much of what is now known as [[Berry, New South Wales|Berry - the town was named after him]]) is well remembered by his tenants.]]\n\n===United States===\nIn the [[United States]], [[residential]] homeowner\u2013tenant disputes are primarily governed by [[state law]] (not [[federal law]]) regarding [[property]] and [[contracts]].  State law and, in some places, city law or county law, sets the requirements for [[eviction]] of a tenant.  Generally, there are a limited number of reasons for which a landlord or landlady can evict his or her tenant before the expiration of the tenancy, though at the end of the lease term the rental relationship can generally be terminated without giving any reason. Some cities, counties, and States have laws establishing the maximum rent a landlord can charge, known as rent control, or [[rent regulation]], and related [[eviction]]. There is also an [[Implied warranty of habitability#Habitability|implied warranty of habitability]], whereby a landlord must maintain safe, decent and habitable housing, meeting minimum safety requirements such as smoke detectors and a locking door.\n\n===Canada===\nIn [[Canada]],  [[residential]] homeowner\u2013tenant disputes are primarily governed by [[provincial law]] (not [[federal law]]) regarding [[property]] and [[contracts]].  Provincial  law sets the requirements for [[eviction]] of a tenant.  Generally, there are a limited number of reasons for which a landlord  can evict a tenant. Some provinces have laws establishing the maximum rent a landlord can charge, known as rent control, or [[rent regulation]], and related [[eviction]]. There is also an [[Implied warranty of habitability#Habitability|implied warranty of habitability]], whereby a landlord must maintain safe, decent and habitable housing, meeting minimum safety requirements.\n\n===United Kingdom===\n{{See also|English land law#Leases and licences|Scots property law}}\n;Residential rental market (tenancies)\nPrivate sector renting is largely governed by many of the [[Landlord and Tenant Act]]s, in particular the [[Landlord and Tenant Act 1985]] which sets bare minimum standards in tenants' rights against their landlords.  Another key statute is the [[Housing Act 2004]].  Rents can be freely increased at the end of a usual six-month duration, on proper notice given to the tenant. A Possession Order under the most common type, the [[Assured Shorthold Tenancy]] (AST) is usually obtainable after eight weeks\/two months of unpaid rent, and at the court's discretion after serving the tenant with a [[Section 8 notice]] (under the [[Housing Act 1988]] as amended) for a lesser period for all assured tenancies &mdash; and on other grounds which defer to the landlord's ownership of the property.  If the tenancy is an AST then any possession order will not take effect until six months has passed into the initial tenancy.  A tenancy of someone who has been in occupation since before 15 January 1989 usually, if not a shorthold from the outset following their inception from 1980 onwards, may be a \"[[regulated tenancy]]\" with many more rights, especially under the [[Rent Act 1977]] and [[Protection from Eviction Act 1977]], introduced by the [[Third Wilson ministry]].<ref>http:\/\/assets.publishing.service.gov.uk\/government\/uploads\/system\/uploads\/attachment_data\/file\/11445\/138295.pdf<\/ref>\n\nEach [[house in multiple occupation]], a unit the law does not regard it as a single household having more than three tenants, is subject to enhanced regulations including the [[Housing Act 2004]]. A council-issued Licence to be a landlord of such a unit is always required in some local authorities (in others, limited to the larger statutory examples).\n\n;Residential leasehold\nTenancies above a couple of years are normally called leases and tend to be long; if more than 7 years a new leasehold estate must be registered.<ref>[[LRA 2002]], Sch.3<\/ref> These are governed by few of the above rules and are in longer examples deliberately more akin to full ownership than tenancies, in general.  They seldom require a sizeable [[ground rent]]. The law has not regulated hefty break\/resale charges nor does it prevent the sale of leasehold houses; in the 2010s certain of these proposals have been widely consulted upon and are being drafted.  Broadly, legislation allows such lessees (tenants) to club together to gain the [[Right to Manage]], and the right to buy the landlord's interest (to collectively enfranchise). It allows them individually to extend their leases for a new, smaller sum (\"premium\"), which if the tenants have enfranchised will not normally be demanded\/recommended every 15-35 years.  Notice requirements and forms tend to be strict. In smaller examples the tenant, depending on a simple mathematical division of the building, may be able to enfranchise individually. Statute of 1925 implies into nearly all leases (tenancies at low rent and at a premium (fine, initial large sum)) of property that they can be sold (by the lessee, assigned); reducing any restriction to one whereby the landlord may apply standard that is \"reasonable\" vetting, without causing major delay. This is often known as the \"statutory qualified covenant on assignment\/alienation\".\n\nIn the overall diminishing domain of [[social housing]], exceptionally, lessees widely acquire over time the [[Right to Buy]] for a fixed discount on the market price of the home.\n\n;Commercial (business) leases and tenancies\nIn commercial property much of the law, especially as to disputes and basic responsibilities, is based on freedom of contract of the [[common law]] including the implied terms of precedent decisions of wide-ranging case law such as the meaning of \"good and substantial repair\". Implied principles include \"non-derogation from grant\" and \"quiet enjoyment\". All businesses which are tenants (lessees) must decide whether to contract in or outside of Part 2 (i.e. II) the [[Landlord and Tenant Act 1954]] which gives them \"business security of tenure\". If not, it generally applies by default. This \"security of tenure\" is expressly subject to common reasons and associated mechanisms for a landlord to obtain back the premises.  If a landlord is selling a block and a qualifying tenant occupies more than 50%, the tenant should be given the [[right of first refusal]] at the asking price to buy the block. As in most jurisdictions the law on rigorous adherence to lease terms on unlawful subletting and assignment can be strictly enforced, resulting in financial and premises loss if broken. Failure to repay a rent demand, unlike residential, can result in direct landlord's repossession (\"peaceable re-entry\").  The taking of a tenant's goods without a court-issued warrant (flowing from a court order or outstanding tax demand) ([[Distress (law)|distress]]) has been banned.<ref>[http:\/\/researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk\/documents\/SN04103\/SN04103.pdf ''Bailiffs''] Lorraine Conway and Jack Dent. House of Commons Library: Briefing Paper Number 04103, 9 June 2017<\/ref>\n\n==Rental investment and basis==\n;Incentives and disincentives\nThe incentive, certainly if not [[social housing]], is to obtain a good rental yield (annual return on investment) and prospect of property price inflation. The disincentives are the locally varying duties of landlords in repair\/maintenance and administration &mdash; and keynote risks (tenant disputes, damage, neglect, loss of rent, insurance inavailability\/disputes, economic slump, increased rate of interest on any mortgage, and negative equity or loss of investment).  Net income (yield) and capital growth from [[letting]] (renting out) particularly in leveraged [[buy to let]], is subject to [[Idiosyncrasy#Idiosyncrasy in economics|idiosyncratic risk]], which is considered objectively intensified for a highly [[Leverage (finance)|leveraged]] investor limited to a small number of similar profile homes, of narrow rental market appeal in areas lacking economic resilience.<ref name=NYT032913>{{cite news|title=Rental Investment May Seem Safer Than It Really Is|url=https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2013\/03\/30\/your-money\/investing-in-a-rental-home-isnt-as-safe-as-it-may-seem.html|accessdate=March 30, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 29, 2013|author=Tara Siegel Barnard}}<\/ref>\n\n;Basis\nRental properties can be paid for by the tenant on whatever basis agreed between the landlord and the tenant &mdash; more frequently than weekly or less than yearly is almost unheard of &mdash; and which is always included in the lease agreement (preferably for both sides in writing). It should be one of the factors that a tenant considers before moving in. \n\n;Security for rent and extra fees\n{{See also|Security deposit|Landlords' insurance}}\nA landlord or its agent can decide to collect a security deposit (and\/or in some jurisdictions such as parts of the US, a move-in\/administration fee). A deterrent if high and a relative attractive if low in many markets for a tenant, it is rarely debated in pre-tenancy term negotiations. In some jurisdictions either or both are banned in the original sense. Instead a landlord's loss of rent\/comprehensive damage insurance may be factored into the rent agreed and\/or a special type of deposit, a regulated sum of money as a bond (protected security deposit) from the tenant held by a registered third party (such as certain realty agents) may be permissible.  A deposit is normally by law to be offset against arrears (rent deficits) and damage by or failures to clean\/repair by the tenant.\n\n==Licensed victualler==\n{{Main article|Pub}}\n\nIn the [[United Kingdom]], the owner and\/or manager of a pub, or public house, is usually called the \"landlord\/landlady\", and often, strictly incorrectly, \"[[publican]]\", the latter properly the appellation of a Roman public contractor or [[Tax farming|tax farmer]]. In a more formal situations, the term used is '''licensed victualler''' or simply \"licensee\".<ref name='Dictionary.com'>{{cite web|url=http:\/\/dictionary.reference.com\/browse\/victualler |title= Dictionary.com |accessdate=2008-07-19 }}<\/ref> A female landlord can either be called a ''landlady'' or simply landlord.\n\nThe [[Licensed Trade Charity]], formed in 2004 from the merger of the Society of Licensed Victuallers and Licensed Victualler's National Homes,<ref>{{EW charity|230011|Society of Licensed Victuallers}}<\/ref> exists to serve the retirement needs of Britain's pub landlords. The charity also runs three private schools in [[Ascot, Berkshire|Ascot]] and [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]] in [[Berkshire]] and [[Sayers Common]] in [[Sussex]]. As well as having normal full fee paying students, [[Licensed Victuallers' School]] in Ascot provides discounted education prices for the children of landlords and others in the catering industry.\n\n==Landlord associations in Australia==\n\nThere are significant associations of  landlords in [[Australia]].

Anping, Hebei.jpg|thumb|280px|Powerful landlord in chariot. [[Eastern Han]] 25-220 CE. [[Hebei]], China.]]\nA '''landlord''' is the owner of a [[house]], [[apartment]], [[condominium]], land or [[real estate]] which is [[Renting|rent]]ed or [[lease]]d to an individual or business, who is called a [[Leasehold estate|tenant]] (also a ''lessee'' or ''renter'').  When a [[juristic person]] is in this position, the term landlord is used. Other terms include '''lessor''' and '''owner'''. The term '''landlady''' may be used for [[women]] owners, and lessor may be used regardless of [[gender identity]].\n\n==History==\nThe concept of a landlord may be traced back to the [[feudalism|feudal]] system of [[manoralism]] ([[seignorialism]]), where a [[landed estate]] is owned by a [[Lord of the Manor]] ([[mesne lord]]s), usually members of the lower nobility which came to form the rank of [[knight]]s in the high medieval period, holding their fief via [[subinfeudation]], but in some cases the land may also be directly subject to a member of higher nobility, as in the [[royal domain]] directly owned by a king, or in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] [[Imperial Village|imperial villages]] directly subject to the emperor.\nThe medieval system ultimately continues the system of [[Roman villa|villas]] and [[latifundium|latifundia]] (peasant-worked broad farmsteads) of the [[Roman Empire]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http:\/\/faculty.history.wisc.edu\/sommerville\/123\/feudalism.htm|title=Feudalism|author=|date=|website=faculty.history.wisc.edu|accessdate=14 March 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20170405034238\/http:\/\/faculty.history.wisc.edu\/sommerville\/123\/feudalism.htm|archivedate=5 April 2017|df=}}<\/ref>\n\nIn modern times, landlord describes any individual(s) or entity (e.g. government body or institution) providing housing for persons who cannot afford or do not want to own their own homes. They may be peripatetic, stationed on a secondment away from their home, not want the risk of a mortgage and\/or negative equity, may be a group of co-occupiers unwilling to enter into the ties of co-ownership, or may be improving their credit rating or bank balance to obtain a better-terms future mortgage. \n\n===Social stigmas of lower-market landlords and tenants in a property-owning culture===\nRenters (tenants or other licensees) at the lowest end of the payment scale may be in social or economic difficulty and due to their address or length of tenure may suffer a [[social stigma]].\n\nA sometimes widely promoted social stigma can impact certain for-profit owners of rental property, especially in troubled neighborhoods.  The term \"slumlord\" \/ \"slum landlord\" is sometimes used to describe landlords in those circumstances.  Public improvement money\/private major economic investment can improve areas and negate the stigma.  In the extreme government [[compulsory purchase]] powers in many countries enable [[slum clearance]] to replace the worst of neighbourhoods.\n\nExamples:\n*In [[Minneapolis]], downmarket landlords vocally and financially opposed a major reform and redevelopment plan of city officials and, in the 2001 election, succeeded in defeating the incumbent mayor and half the city council.<ref> {{cite web |url=http:\/\/www.landlordpolitics.com\/landlord.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-06-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20160623180446\/http:\/\/www.landlordpolitics.com\/landlord.html |archivedate=2016-06-23 |df= }} Minneapolis Property Rights Action Committee events & adventures<\/ref> \n\n*[[Peter Rachman]] was a [[landlord]] who operated in [[Notting Hill]], [[London]] in the 1950s and until his 1962 death. He became notorious for exploitation of his [[Leasehold estate|tenants]], with the word \"'''Rachmanism'''\" entering the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''. His henchmen included [[Michael X|Michael de Freitas]] (aka Michael X\/Abdul Malik), who created a reputation as a black-power leader, and [[Johnny Edgecombe]], who became a promoter of jazz and blues, which helped to keep him in the limelight.<ref name=\"Three\">{{cite web|url=http:\/\/www.historytalk.org\/Tom+Vague+Pop+History\/Chp+1.pdf|title=\u2013 historytalk.org|author=|date=|website=www.historytalk.org|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20161003054425\/http:\/\/www.historytalk.org\/Tom%20Vague%20Pop%20History\/Chp%201.pdf|archivedate=2016-10-03|df=}}<\/ref>\n\n==Owner and tenant responsibilities==\nA [[rental agreement]], or ''lease'', is the [[contract]] defining such terms as the price paid, penalties for late payments, the length of the rental or lease, and the amount of notice required before either the homeowner or tenant cancels the agreement.  In general, responsibilities are given as follows: the homeowner is responsible for making repairs and performing property maintenance, and the tenant is responsible for keeping the property clean and safe.\n\nMany owners hire a [[property management]] company to take care of all the details of renting their property out to a tenant. This usually includes advertising the property and showing it to prospective tenants, negotiating and preparing the written leases, and then, once rented, collecting rent from the tenant and performing repairs as needed.\n\n[[Image:E9438-David-Berry-monument.jpg|thumb|Being a good landlord, [[David Berry (landowner)|David Berry]] (who had owned much of what is now known as [[Berry, New South Wales|Berry - the town was named after him]]) is well remembered by his tenants.]]\n\n===United States===\nIn the [[United States]], [[residential]] homeowner\u2013tenant disputes are primarily governed by [[state law]] (not [[federal law]]) regarding [[property]] and [[contracts]].  State law and, in some places, city law or county law, sets the requirements for [[eviction]] of a tenant.  Generally, there are a limited number of reasons for which a landlord or landlady can evict his or her tenant before the expiration of the tenancy, though at the end of the lease term the rental relationship can generally be terminated without giving any reason. Some cities, counties, and States have laws establishing the maximum rent a landlord can charge, known as rent control, or [[rent regulation]], and related [[eviction]]. There is also an [[Implied warranty of habitability#Habitability|implied warranty of habitability]], whereby a landlord must maintain safe, decent and habitable housing, meeting minimum safety requirements such as smoke detectors and a locking door.\n\n===Canada===\nIn [[Canada]],  [[residential]] homeowner\u2013tenant disputes are primarily governed by [[provincial law]] (not [[federal law]]) regarding [[property]] and [[contracts]].  Provincial  law sets the requirements for [[eviction]] of a tenant.  Generally, there are a limited number of reasons for which a landlord  can evict a tenant. Some provinces have laws establishing the maximum rent a landlord can charge, known as rent control, or [[rent regulation]], and related [[eviction]]. There is also an [[Implied warranty of habitability#Habitability|implied warranty of habitability]], whereby a landlord must maintain safe, decent and habitable housing, meeting minimum safety requirements.\n\n===United Kingdom===\n{{See also|English land law#Leases and licences|Scots property law}}\n;Residential rental market (tenancies)\nPrivate sector renting is largely governed by many of the [[Landlord and Tenant Act]]s, in particular the [[Landlord and Tenant Act 1985]] which sets bare minimum standards in tenants' rights against their landlords.  Another key statute is the [[Housing Act 2004]].  Rents can be freely increased at the end of a usual six-month duration, on proper notice given to the tenant. A Possession Order under the most common type, the [[Assured Shorthold Tenancy]] (AST) is usually obtainable after eight weeks\/two months of unpaid rent, and at the court's discretion after serving the tenant with a [[Section 8 notice]] (under the [[Housing Act 1988]] as amended) for a lesser period for all assured tenancies &mdash; and on other grounds which defer to the landlord's ownership of the property.  If the tenancy is an AST then any possession order will not take effect until six months has passed into the initial tenancy.  A tenancy of someone who has been in occupation since before 15 January 1989 usually, if not a shorthold from the outset following their inception from 1980 onwards, may be a \"[[regulated tenancy]]\" with many more rights, especially under the [[Rent Act 1977]] and [[Protection from Eviction Act 1977]], introduced by the [[Third Wilson ministry]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http:\/\/assets.publishing.service.gov.uk\/government\/uploads\/system\/uploads\/attachment_data\/file\/11445\/138295.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2018-04-12 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20180413130952\/https:\/\/assets.publishing.service.gov.uk\/government\/uploads\/system\/uploads\/attachment_data\/file\/11445\/138295.pdf |archivedate=2018-04-13 |df= }}<\/ref>\n\nEach [[house in multiple occupation]], a unit the law does not regard it as a single household having more than three tenants, is subject to enhanced regulations including the [[Housing Act 2004]]. A council-issued Licence to be a landlord of such a unit is always required in some local authorities (in others, limited to the larger statutory examples).\n\n;Residential leasehold\nTenancies above a couple of years are normally called leases and tend to be long; if more than 7 years a new leasehold estate must be registered.<ref>[[LRA 2002]], Sch.3<\/ref> These are governed by few of the above rules and are in longer examples deliberately more akin to full ownership than tenancies, in general.  They seldom require a sizeable [[ground rent]]. The law has not regulated hefty break\/resale charges nor does it prevent the sale of leasehold houses; in the 2010s certain of these proposals have been widely consulted upon and are being drafted.  Broadly, legislation allows such lessees (tenants) to club together to gain the [[Right to Manage]], and the right to buy the landlord's interest (to collectively enfranchise). It allows them individually to extend their leases for a new, smaller sum (\"premium\"), which if the tenants have enfranchised will not normally be demanded\/recommended every 15-35 years.  Notice requirements and forms tend to be strict. In smaller examples the tenant, depending on a simple mathematical division of the building, may be able to enfranchise individually. Statute of 1925 implies into nearly all leases (tenancies at low rent and at a premium (fine, initial large sum)) of property that they can be sold (by the lessee, assigned); reducing any restriction to one whereby the landlord may apply standard that is \"reasonable\" vetting, without causing major delay. This is often known as the \"statutory qualified covenant on assignment\/alienation\".\n\nIn the overall diminishing domain of [[social housing]], exceptionally, lessees widely acquire over time the [[Right to Buy]] for a fixed discount on the market price of the home.\n\n;Commercial (business) leases and tenancies\nIn commercial property much of the law, especially as to disputes and basic responsibilities, is based on freedom of contract of the [[common law]] including the implied terms of precedent decisions of wide-ranging case law such as the meaning of \"good and substantial repair\". Implied principles include \"non-derogation from grant\" and \"quiet enjoyment\". All businesses which are tenants (lessees) must decide whether to contract in or outside of Part 2 (i.e. II) the [[Landlord and Tenant Act 1954]] which gives them \"business security of tenure\". If not, it generally applies by default. This \"security of tenure\" is expressly subject to common reasons and associated mechanisms for a landlord to obtain back the premises.  If a landlord is selling a block and a qualifying tenant occupies more than 50%, the tenant should be given the [[right of first refusal]] at the asking price to buy the block. As in most jurisdictions the law on rigorous adherence to lease terms on unlawful subletting and assignment can be strictly enforced, resulting in financial and premises loss if broken. Failure to repay a rent demand, unlike residential, can result in direct landlord's repossession (\"peaceable re-entry\").  The taking of a tenant's goods without a court-issued warrant (flowing from a court order or outstanding tax demand) ([[Distress (law)|distress]]) has been banned.<ref>[http:\/\/researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk\/documents\/SN04103\/SN04103.pdf ''Bailiffs''] {{webarchive|url=https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20180413043651\/http:\/\/researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk\/documents\/SN04103\/SN04103.pdf |date=2018-04-13 }} Lorraine Conway and Jack Dent.

It should be one of the factors that a tenant considers before moving in. \n\n;Security for rent and extra fees\n{{See also|Security deposit|Landlords' insurance}}\nA landlord or its agent can decide to collect a security deposit (and\/or in some jurisdictions such as parts of the US, a move-in\/administration fee). A deterrent if high and a relative attractive if low in many markets for a tenant, it is rarely debated in pre-tenancy term negotiations. In some jurisdictions either or both are banned in the original sense. Instead a landlord's loss of rent\/comprehensive damage insurance may be factored into the rent agreed and\/or a special type of deposit, a regulated sum of money as a bond (protected security deposit) from the tenant held by a registered third party (such as certain realty agents) may be permissible.  A deposit is normally by law to be offset against arrears (rent deficits) and damage by or failures to clean\/repair by the tenant.\n\n==Licensed victualler==\n{{Main article|Pub}}\n\nIn the [[United Kingdom]], the owner and\/or manager of a pub, or public house, is usually called the \"landlord\/landlady\", and often, strictly incorrectly, \"[[publican]]\", the latter properly the appellation of a Roman public contractor or [[Tax farming|tax farmer]].
